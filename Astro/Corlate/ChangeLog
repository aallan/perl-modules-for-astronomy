2001-12-12  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Inital release version.
        
        * Corlate.pm: Added minimum necessary functionality
        
        * t/corlate.t: Checks info.dat file in $ESTAR_DATA to see if
          the correct contents have been generated.

        * Wrapper/Makefile.PL: Changed to link using f95, undocumented
          feature in ExtUtils::F77
          
        * Wrapper/Wrapper.xs: Modified PACKAGE line to put the corlate()
          function in the right namespace.  
          
        * t/wrapper.t: Modified so that it can actually find the catalog
          files, does a check on the info.dat file to see if the correct
          contents have been generated.
