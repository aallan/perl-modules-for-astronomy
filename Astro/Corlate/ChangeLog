        * Astro::Corlate::Wrapper code now works correctly. 

        * Wrapper/Makefile.PL: Changed to link using f95, undocumented
          feature in ExtUtils::F77
          
        * Wrapper/Wrapper.xs: Modified PACKAGE line to put the corlate()
          function in the right namespace.  
          
        * t/wrapper.t: Modified so that it can actually find the catalog
          files, does a check on the info.dat file to see if the correct
          contents have been generated.
