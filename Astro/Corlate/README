Astro::Corlate modules
----------------------  

What is it?
-----------

The Astro::Corlate module is an semi-OO interface to the Fortran 90 Corlate
package. Corlate compares two CLUSTER format catalogue files, one typically
being the results of a new observation, and the other a reference catalogue
such as the USNO-A2. It returns an array of files with information on any
variable objects found during the cross-corelation of the two catalogues.

CLUSTER format files can be handled using the Astro::Catalog::Cluster module,
and the USNO-A2 catalogue for defined sky regions retrieved seamlessly using
the Astro::Catalog::USNOA2 module. Both of these modules are available from
the eSTAR website (http://www.estar.org.uk/). 

Why do it?
----------

This module was written as part of the eSTAR project.

Requirements
------------

The module is an XS wrapper for the Fortran 90 corlate code. It requires a
Fortran 90 compiler, such as the NAG f95 compiler, to build. XS and the
ExtUtils::F77 module was not designed to wrap F90 code and some liberties
were taken during when wrapping the subroutine library. These may cause
difficulties when trying to compile the module on a non-native platform.

Provides
--------

The package provides the following classes

    Astro::Corlate
    Astro::Corlate::Wrapper
    
and the following Fortran 90 module libraries

    libCorlate.a    

Where can I get it?
-------------------

The package is availabe from CPAN <http://www.cpan.org/> and from
the eSTAR Project at http://www.estar.org.uk

Installation
------------

You should first build the libCorlate.a library, see the Wrapper/Fortran
directory and follow the instructions in the README file there. A Fortran
90 compiler is needed to build the library.

Installation is automated using the ExtUtils::MakeMaker library

     % perl Makefile.PL
     % make
     % make test
     % make install

Authors
-------

The Corlate fortran module was written by Tim Naylor <timn@astro.ex.ac.uk>,
of the University of Exeter Astrophysics Group (http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/). 
The Perl wrapper was written by Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>, as part 
of his work for the eSTAR project.

the writing of the Corlate Perl wrapper.
