Astro::DDS module
-----------------  

What is it?
-----------

The module is an object orientated interface to the both the first and second
Digital Sky Surveys at the ESO-ECF online archive. While the first sky survey
is 100% complete, the second survey covers 98% of the sky in Red, 45% of the 
sky in Blue and 27% of the sky in the Infra-red.

Why do it?
----------

While other, currently undistributed, interfaces to the sky survey are in
existance, there isn't one generally available. This module, while not as
feature complete as some other interfaces is a quick and dirty interface
was fairly easy to code up using bits and pieces of other eSTAR modules,
see Astro::SIMBAD and Astro::ADS for instance.

Requirements
------------

The module requires the libwww-perl-5.60 package written by Gisle Aas
<gisle@ActiveState.com> v5.53 or above. This package can be obtained
via CPAN at http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=libwww-perl

Also required is the Net::Domain module, v2.13 or above, by Graham
Barr <gbarr@pobox.com>. This module has been included in the base
distribution since Perl 5.7.2, but otherwise can be downloaded from
CPAN as part of the libnet package, see http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=libnet
