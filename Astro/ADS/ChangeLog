        * ADS.pm: Introduced a placeholder class to get round a documentation
          bug on search.cpan.org.

2003-07-02  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Removed some tests from t/*.t since the things they were based
          on kept changing and I had to update the module every time. The
          test quite is now somewhat uncomplete. This is not good.

        * Query/Query.pm: Fixed a bug which meant that that followup
	  queries no longer worked with the new interface.

2002-09-03  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Query/Query.pm: Modified query string to reflect changes in
          the ADS interface, if you wondered where the Journal strings
          went this should fix it. Fixed handling of 500 errors as these
          are now returned under some circumstances by ADS when no results 
          are found.
          
        * t/paper.t: Fixed tests, same problem.

2002-01-09  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Query/Query.pm: Added start & end year/month options to the
