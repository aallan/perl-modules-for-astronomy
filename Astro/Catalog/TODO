To Do (16th June 2004)
---------------------

 * Introduce support for quality flags with Astro::Catalog::Item::Quality  
   object.
   
 * Fix things so all "values" are represented by the new Number::Uncertainty
   object and can have associated errors. Currently only flux values use the
   new Number::Uncertainty class.
  
 * Add output support for FITS binary tables. 
   
 * Support the VOTable V1.1 standard.
 
 * Fix Astro::Catalog::Query::CMC module to correctly parse the CMC TST files,
   currently support is somewhat broken. The module itself may no longer work
   at all under the new V4 API.
 
 * Add writing support for TST files to Astro::Catalog::IO::TST

 * Fix Astro::Catalog::Query::SkyCat and Astro::Catalog::Query::Vizier to
   be truely generic (or at least work in more cases out of the box).
   
 * Change Astro::Catalog::Query::Vizier to use VOTables for easier parsing?
    
 * Add further catalogue query classes?
