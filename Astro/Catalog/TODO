To Do
-----
 
 * Add support for FITS binary tables  
   
 * Work with Astro::Catalog::IO::VOTable to provide better reader support,
   update it to support VOTable 1.1 when it gets finalised.
  
 * Need to added Epoch and Equinox support, possibly inside Astro::Coords
   rather than in Astro::Catalog::Star itself?
 
 * Fix Astro::Catalog::Query::CMC module to correctly parse the CMC TST files,
   currently support is somewhat broken.
 
 * Add writing support for TST files to Astro::Catalog::IO::TST

 * Fix Astro::Catalog::Query::SkyCat and Astro::Catalog::Query::Vizier to
   be truely generic (or at least work in more cases out of the box).
   
 * Change Astro::Catalog::Query::Vizier to use VOTables for easier parsing?
    
 * Add further catalogue query classes?
