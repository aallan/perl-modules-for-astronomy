File which have been superceeded, but still contain useful (alternative)
implementations that I want to keep around just in case I need them again.


 Query/Query/SuperCOSMOS.pm

    The SuperCOSMOS catalogue is now retrieved by a custom interface into
    SkyCat. This code was the older interface that used Astro::Aladin to
    retrieve the catalogue. It's useful, we should keep it.
 
 t/4_supercos.t
 
    The test suite that went with the older SuperCOSMOS module.

 t/4_skycat_usno.t
 
    Due to problems with the SkyCat module this test suite doesn't work,
    need to resolve these problems and drop this module back into the
    distribution as soon as possible.
    
 t/4_gsc_cmp_skycat.t

    The current Astro::Catalog::Query::SkyCat module doesn't work properly
    as it doesn't correctly parse the returned TST files in alot of cases,
    the GSC is one of these cases. So, currently, the custom GSC module and
    the SkyCat GSC module don't return the same thing. I'm saving this code
    until they do and it becomes useful again.

 test.pl
 
    A simple test script which resolves a target using the 
    Astro::Catalog::Query::SIMBAD module, then retrieves a small cone
    search around the target.
