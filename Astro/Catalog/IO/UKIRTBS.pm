=head1 NAME

Astro::Catalog::IO::UKIRTBS - Old format used by UKIRT Bright Star catalogues

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $cat = Astro::Catalog::IO::UKIRTBS->_read_catalog( \@lines );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a read method for catalogs written in a format
used by the old C<ukstar> web interface to the SAO and Bright Star
catalogues. It is probable that this format has a real name and is a
historical format rather than a UKIRT-specific format but the history
of C<ukstar> and the associated catalogue files is not known to the
author of this module.

Parses the catalogue lines and returns a new C<Astro::Catalog>
object containing the catalog entries.

 $cat = Astro::Catalog::IO::JCMT->_read_catalog( \@lines );

No options are supported.

=head1 FORMAT

The catalog format uses fixed formatting (first column is column 1):

 Columns
  1-7     star id
 10-20    Right Ascension (presumed B1950). Radians
 21-32    Declination (presumed B1950). Radians
 33-38    "rap"  (unknown)
 39-44    "decp" (unknown)
 45-49    V Magnitude
 50-      Spectral type
