=head1 NAME

Astro::Catalog::IO::GaiaPick - Catalogue reader for GAIA Pick Object files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $cat = Astro::Catalog::IO::GaiaPick->_read_catalog( \@lines );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a read method for catalogues in the GAIA Pick
Object catalogue format. This format is written by the Starlink GAIA
application when a user requests the result of a "Pick Object" are to
be saved. The method is not public and should, in general, only be
called from the C<Astro::Catalog> C<read_catalog> method.

=head1 FORMAT

The GaiaPick format is extremely simple. First there is an informational
header that describes the subsequent columns. This is a single line:

  # name   x y ra dec equinox angle   peak    background fwhm (X:Y)

(white space has been compressed in this description to remove the
need for line wrapping). The results of the "Pick Object" are then
written to the following lines, using up two lines per pick as
follows:

  # Sunday February 08 2004 - 16:43:59
  iras.sdf 153.3 151.5 00:42:45.757 +41:16:44.96 J2000 160.7 2.7 1.4 7.8 : 6.1

The first line indicates the date of the pick. The second line
contains the parameters of the source.

Currently the reader does not attempt to parse the first line in order
to derive the column information. The assumption is that the columns
are always in the same order.
