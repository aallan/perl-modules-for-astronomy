2005-07-08  Brad Cavanagh  <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Catalog.pm: Rework sorting so that only specific values
	are calculated depending on if that type of sort is being
	done (i.e. if sorting by 'ra', only the RA is calculated
	and not azimuth, elevation, etc).

2005-07-01  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* IO/JCMT.pm: Now read/write Velocity information 

2005-06-26 Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> 

        * Query/Query/Sesame.pm: Fixed problems with Sesame endpoint.
	
2005-06-24 Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* IO/FITSTable.pm: Modified to use flux measurements directly
	  instead of importing a specific one into a magnitude. Added
	  support for reading DATE-OBS header to apply timestamp for
	  flux measurements.

2005-06-23 Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> 

        * Fixed after slight breakage from modifications to Astro::Flux
	
2005-06-20 Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> 

        * Item.pm: Added fluxdatestamp() function which allows you to append
	  a time stamp to all the Astro::Flux objects held in the Item. Also
	  addeddistancetostar() and within() methods to allow us to easily
	  figure out if one star is close to another.
	  
	* t/4_mpc.t: Updated tests again. Must be better way to do this?   
	
2005-06-16 Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>  (Version 4.0)

        * Query/Query/*.pm: All query classes updated. The package passes
	  all test, however many parts of the test suite do not have anything
	  like full coverage. I think we have to expect some bugs at this
	  stage.Theoretically fully working Astro::Catalog distribution
	  however, so lets badge this as V4.

2005-06-15 Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Basic fixes to Catalog.pm and IO/Cluster.pm to support the new
	  changes. Hopefully this will provide a springboard so I can fix
	  the rest of the IO and Query modules. This is a big job...
	  
	* IO/*.pm: All IO classes working, I think?  

2005-06-12 Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Series of changes breaking backwards compatibility in Item.pm to
	  support the new Astro::Fluxes objects and Number::Uncertainty for
	  magnitude and colour support. These changes break all other classes
	  in the package.

2005-06-04  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Removed Astro::Catalog::Star and Astro::Catalog::Star::Morphology
	  and replaces with corresponding Item classes. The Star classes are
	  retained as empty-subclasses for backwards compatibility.

2005-06-04  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 3.9.9)

        * Updated documentation and released as version 3.9.9
        
        * Quary/Query/Sesame.pm: Removed reference from Math::Libm

2005-06-04  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>
        
	* t/2_fitstable.t: Change magnitude test to use the log_10 of the 
	  flux.

        * t/4_mpc.t: Fix up MPC tests again

2005-06-03  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* IO/FITSTable.pm: Convert flux to magnitudes with log_10,
	  not natural logarithm.
	
2005-03-30  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* IO/ASCII.pm: base class for ASCII-based IO

	* IO/Binary.pm: base class for binary-based IO

	* Catalog.pm: added FITSTable support; modified IO class handling
	  to farm off to IO classes that inherit from either IO/ASCII.pm
	  or IO/Binary.pm to allow for reading in of different types of
	  files; modify ID matching to use string comparison instead of
	  numerical comparison in case IDs aren't numbers.

	* IO/Astrom.pm, IO/Cluster.pm, IO/FINDOFF.pm, IO/GaiaPick.pm,
	  IO/JCMT.pm, IO/SExtractor.pm, IO/STL.pm, IO/Simple.pm,
	  IO/TST.pm, IO/UKIRTBS.pm, IO/VOTable.pm: inherit from IO/ASCII.pm.

	* IO/FITSTable.pm: new module to allow reading in of binary FITS
	  tables.

2005-03-22  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* IO/FINDOFF.pm: Remove letters from ID string before writing.
	  This is done because FINDOFF doesn't understand non-integers.

2005-02-25  Tim Jenness  <t.jenness@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Catalog.pm (filter_by_id): Use quotemeta function to make sure
	  that things like + and () are escaped before being passed to the
	  regex engine.

2005-02-15  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* IO/Astrom.pm: Add epoch of observation support.

	* Catalog.pm: Allow newer versions of Astro::Coords to be used
	  without breaking up output from the ra and dec methods.

	* Star/Star.pm: Add wcs method allowing for a world coordinate
	  system to be associated with a star. Allow for calculation of x/y
	  position from ra/dec if possible. Allow newer versions of
	  Astro::Coords to be used without screwing up output from the ra
	  and dec methods.

2005-02-03  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Query/Query/2MASS.pm: Tell TST which column the ID is in when
	  forming the new catalogue from the 2MASS output. This is done to
	  prevent a warning from appearing when TST tries to parse the
	  catalogue.

2005-02-02  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 3.9.0)

	* Star/Star.pm: Fixed quality comparison in line 860 (now 865) so
	  it can handle undef values. Not sure this was the right thing to,
	  why was it getting undef values to start with? This could indicate
	  a bug in one of the IO plugin modules?

2005-02-02  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* t/2_astrom.t: __DATA__ section needed updating to use
	  publically- available Astro::Coords.

	* IO/Astrom.pm: Use Astro::Coords v0.05 methods instead of v0.06.

	* t/helper.pl: Add compare_mpc_catalog and compare_mpc_star for
	  MPC checking.

	* t/4_mpc.t: Use compare_mpc_catalog comparison method, update
	  asteroid positions.

2005-02-01  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* IO/FINDOFF.pm: Fix regex bug, clarify documentation, only write
	  ID in comment column.

	* IO/SExtractor.pm: Declare filter variable to fix syntax error.

2005-01-18  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* MANIFEST: Fixed problems with MANIFEST file

2005-01-14  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Catalog.pm, IO/FINDOFF.pm, t/2_findoff.t: support for Starlink 
	  FINDOFF input/output file format

2005-01-13  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* IO/SExtractor.pm: allow filter to be passed as argument to
	  _read_catalog method.
	* IO/Astrom.pm, t/2_astrom.t: support for Starlink ASTROM input 
	  file format

2004-12-21  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* IO/SExtractor.pm: add support for morphology, x and y position, 
	  and add more debugging statements.

	* Star/Morphology/Morphology.pm: add area to list of attributes.

	* t/4_mpc.t: fix tests to correspond to changing asteroid positions.

2004-11-30  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> 

	* IO/VOTable.pm: Changed dependancy to Astro::VO::VOTable away
	from the older VOTable module. Updated docs to reflect this
	change.
          
	* t/2_votable.pm: Updated to reflect changes
        
	* Star/Morphology/Makefile.pm: Added in support of the new class.
        
	* IO/Cluster.pm: Flxed problem with looks_like_number() call 
          
2004-11-23  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Star/Morphology/Morphology.pm: Add simple support for object
          morphology.
          
	* Star.pm: Add morphology accessor method.

2004-11-22  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* IO/SExtractor.pm: Add simple reader for output from SExtractor.

2004-11-05  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* IO/UKIRTBS.pm: Add simple reader for the UKIRT version of the
	Bright Star catalog. This is used by the ukstar web page at UKIRT.

2004-08-11  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* TkAstroCatalog/AstroCatalog.pm: Add demo Catalog browser for Tk

	* Catalog.pm: Add auto_filter_observability

	* IO/JCMT.pm: Publish a method for cleaning the target name (so
	  that the JCMT VAX control system will not get upset) and use that
	  method in the JCMT catalog writer (so that a "use this target"
	  message) is guaranteed to agree with the name in the catalogue.

2004-05-20  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 3.7.0)

	* Updated documentation ready for release.
          
2004-03-02  Brad Cavanagh  <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Added Query/MPC support along with associated test harness.

2004-03-01  Brad Cavanagh  <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* IO/VOTable: added support for parallax and proper motions.
	
2004-02-25  Brad Cavanagh  <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Catalog.pm: added fielddate method.

	* Star/Star.pm: added insertdate method.
	
2004-02-23  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* IO/GaiaPick.pm: Add GaiaPick log file support

2004-02-05  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* t/2_votable.t: Now attempt to skip VOtable tests if the VOTable
	  module is not installed.

2004-02-05  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* IO/STL.pm: Added STL support (read only) as a pluggable IO
	module along with associated test harness.

2003-11-14  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 3.5.2)

	* README: Updated location of VOTable module package, which moved.

2003-10-30  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 3.5.1)

	* IO/Cluster.pm: Added read support for new style character
	quality flags. Cluster files are still written using the old style
	numeric flags.
          
2003-10-17  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 3.5.0)

	* IO/VOTable.pm: Very simple VOTable reader added, should now get
	at least basic information into the Astro::Catalog object if it is
	passed a VOTable.
          
	* t/2_votable.t: Added test harness for reading VOTables.

	* Minor documenation cleanup in various files, no actual
	functionality changes.
          
2003-10-16  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 3.4.0)

	* IO/VOTable.pm: Fixed VOTable output to actually have some
	meta-data, now readable by treeview. Added DEFINITIONS element to
	the table and filled in various "default" meta-data. The tables
	are not bogus, but the epoch and equinoxes may be incorrect in
	some cases (SuperCOSMOS catalogues for instance).
          
2003-10-13  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 3.3.0)

	* IO/VOTable.pm: Added VOTable support (write only) as a pluggable
	IO module along with associated test harness.
          
2003-09-30  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* Query/Query/Sesame.pm: Modified to cope with change in return
	format by CDS.
                  
2003-09-24  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* Query/Query/SIMBAD.pm: Removed debugging statements which
	generated a file containing a copy of the retrieved HTML in the
	current working directory.
               
	* etc/sss.cfg: Added SkyCat SuperCOSMOS configuration file to
	default distribution
        
	* etc/skycat.cfg: Added generic SkyCat configuration file to
	default distribution

	* Query/Query/SkyCat.pm: Updated to look for
	$PERLPREFIX/etc/skycat.cfg configuration file by default.
       
	* Makefile.PL: Modified makefile to install the SkyCat
	configuration files to $(PERLPREFIX)/etc in preperation for
	shifting access to SuperCOSMOS from being dependant on
	Astro::Aladin to using the Astro::Catalog::Query::SkyCat module.
  
	* Query/Query/SuperCOSMOS.pm: Totally reimplemented this module
	from scratch to use the SkyCat.pm module rather than relying on
	the Astro::Aladin implementation.

	* t/4_skycat_supercos.t: Added a test suite for the new
	SuperCOSMOS module. This superceedes the older 4_supercos.t test
	suite.

	* MANIFEST: Updated to reflect the actual package, we've been
	shipping V3.x with bits missing since release, whoops!

	* old/*: Moved some of the non-functional test suite into a this
	directory along with the old Astro::Aladin SuperCOSMOS module.
           
2003-09-24  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* Query/Query/CMC.pm: Added a Vizier Carlsberg Meridian Catalogue
	(CMC/11) query sub-class to try and figure out how Tim had written
	the 2MASS (Vizier generic) class. RA & Dec incorrect.

	* Query/Query/2MASS.pm: Moved colour generation for 2MASS
	catalogue from the more generic IO/TST.pm module.

	* IO/TST.pm: See changes to Query/Query/2MASS.pm
        
2003-09-12  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* Query/Query/Sesame.pm: Modified to cope with change in return
	format by CDS.

	* Query/Query/USNOA2.pm: Fixed problem with USNO-A2 having bogus
	RA and Dec seconds fields (= 60.0) which breaks Astro::Catalog.
	The query module now silently discards these objects (for now!).

	* Query/Query/GSC.pm: Fixed problem with GSC which dropped the B
	magnitude error into the quality flag. Fix breaks the t/4_gsc.t
	test harness.

	* Catalog.pm: Changed default origin of <UNKNOWN> to UNKNOWN to
	avoid parsing problems when the results of a query are displayed
	as part of an HTML page.
                     
2003-08-26  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* Star/Star.pm: Modified quality() routine so it knows about TST
	quality flags. Not a particularly good solution, need to
	generalise this and move it to the IO::TST module.
  
	* IO/Cluster.pm: Moved id() changes for USNO-A2 to generic code in
	the pluggable IO module
  
	* IO/TST.pm: Modified to generate colours and quality flags for
	2MASS

2003-08-03  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* IO/Cluster.pm: Fiddled with the quality flags for Cluster
	output, to get rid of an uninitalised value warning. Still need to
	go to character quality flags.
  
	* Query/Query/USNOA2.pm: Changed the id() of the downloaded
	USNO-A2 stars to be numberic, otherwise we break the cluster
	format which requires numeric id's. Also tweaked the
	$catalog->pushstar() line so if the Astro::Coords object in the
	Astro::Catalog::Star object is broken (bogus dec?) its not going
	to get included in the catalog.
        
2003-08-03  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Query/Query/SIMBAD.pm: All the functionality of Astro::SIMBAD
  	  integrated into Astro::Catalog... 

	* Star/Star.pm: Add startype, spectype, longstartype and moreinfo
	  needed by SIMBAD query.

2003-08-02  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Transport/*.pm: Reorganized as part of SkyCat work 

	* Query/Query/*.pm: All Query classes reorganised to make SkyCat
	  easier. 

	* Query/Query.pm: Much reorganization to support SkyCat class. 

	* Query/Query/SkyCat.pm: Now forms a query and parses the results
	  for an abritrary SkyCat-enabled server. Still not ready for prime
	  time.

	* t/4_*.t: All query tests now use helper.pl
	
	* t/helper.pl: Reusable test components now in separate file 

2003-08-01  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Transport/REST.pm (useragent): Instantiate useragent on demand
	  rather than via configure (useful for skycat interface). Separate
	  construction of URL from retrieval of URL to allow simpler
          subclassing.

2003-07-30  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* IO/TST.pm: Add TST format reader. Still has debug.

2003-07-29  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* Moved Astro::Catalog::BaseQuery to be Astro::Catalog::Query in
	preparation for it be a proper polymorphic factory class for
	generic catalogue queries.

	* Moved actualy query sub-classes down a directory level to allow
	for the Query.pm file
  
	* Transport/WebService.pm: Added a WebService transport class,
	probably needs some added generalisation, but our sample of web
	services is still small.
  
	* Query/Query/Sesame.pm: Added a Sesame.pm class to do CDS Sesame
	lookups by target name using the new WebService transport class.
                       
2003-07-28  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* Moved the catalogue query classes to chare a common namespace,
	current classes now inherit from the
	Astro::Catalog::Transport::REST class. While future web and GRID
	service classes will inherit from related classes. All the
	Astro::Catalog::Transport classes inherit from Tim's BaseQuery
	class.
  
	* Transport/REST.pm: Moved REST specific setup from BaseQuery to
	Transport::REST class

	* t/*.t: Test scripts modified to work within new framework.

	* t/1_compile.t: Now chekc for presence of Astro::Aladin module
        
2003-07-27  Tim Jenness <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Added sorting and filtering of catalogues.

2003-07-26  Tim Jenness <timj@jach.hawaii.edu> & Alasdiar Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>
            
	* Added pluggable IO.
            
2003-07-24  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* t/catalog.t: Tests fixed to reflect the new two decimal place
	precisions generated by using Astro::Coords objects
          
2003-07-24  Tim Jenness <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* BaseQuery/BaseQuery.pm: Write base class for catalog query classes.

	* Catalog.pm (_read_cluster): No longer use ra() and dec() methods
	to set the ra and dec (store the Astro::Coords object directly)

	* Star/Star.pm: ra($ra) and dec($dec) methods now deprecated.

        * t/1_compile.t: New tests addded.
        
2003-07-23  Tim Jenness <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Star/Star.pm: Now uses Astro::Coords internally.

	* Catalog.pm: Now uses Astro::Coords internally. Switch to lexical
	filehandles.

2003-07-19  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (version 2.1.3)

	* Catalog.pm: added patch by Brad Cavanagh to popstarbyid()
        
2003-07-15  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (version 2.1.2)

	* Minor documentation tweaks
        
	* Added some example scripts to the distribution
          
2003-06-10  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* Catalog.pm: Fixed bug in new _read_cluster() routine for
	instances where we're reading from a file.
          
2003-06-09  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* Fixed test scripts for Astro::Catalog::SuperCOSMOS so that they
	fail gracefully if Astro::Aladin isn't installed.
          
	* Astro/Catalog.pm: Astro::Catalog module patched to take an ARK
	catalogue via a scalar rather than from a file. For backwards
	compatibility reasons Astro::Catalog( Cluster => $file ) still
	refers to a serialised version, whereas Astro::Catalog( Scalar =>
	$file ) refers to a scalar holding a string that is an ARK Cluster
	catalogue. This isn't optimal but I don't particularly want to
	break the exisiting (extensive) codebase.

2003-02-24  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* Astro::Catalog now wraps SuperCOSMOS catalogue using the
	Astro::Aladin module. Some example scripts using this new module
	and the Astro::DSS module are included in the distribution. NB:
	This isn't intended to be used seriously by anyone, its not even a
	sub-optimal way of going about things, but I was playing and since
	I wrote the code I may as well distribute the stuff.
          
2002-05-31  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* Removed references to Math::libm from the GSC modules, these
	references seemed to have been missed by the previous patch.
          
2002-05-29  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* Applied patch provided by Stephen Quiney
	<S.J.Quinney@durham.ac.uk>, removes dependancy on Math::libm and
	fixes test script problem which required the $ESTAR_DATA
	environment variable to be set.

2002-03-30  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* Minor bug fix?

2002-03-29  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>
        
	* Added a freeze() function so that the the Catalog object can be
	stored persistently using the Data::Dumper module
          
2002-01-24  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* Various changes made to support the Field Correlation Client,
	note that the USNO-A2 parsing was broken for catalogues with more
	than 1000 stars before this update.

2002-01-14  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* Catalog.pm: Can now read from, and dump to, ARK Cluster files.

2002-01-13  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* Generic Catalog and Star objects working, lacks way to parse ARK
	format Cluster files into Astro::Catalog objects, but all other
	functionality in place.
          
2002-01-10  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* Original version.
