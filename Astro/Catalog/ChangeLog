	* Star/Morphology/Morphology.pm: add area to list of attributes.

	* t/4_mpc.t: fix tests to correspond to changing asteroid positions.

2004-11-30  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> 

        * IO/VOTable.pm: Changed dependancy to Astro::VO::VOTable away
          from the older VOTable module. Updated docs to reflect this
          change.
          
        * t/2_votable.pm: Updated to reflect changes
        
        * Star/Morphology/Makefile.pm: Added in support of the new class.
        
        * IO/Cluster.pm: Flxed problem with looks_like_number() call 
          
2004-11-23  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

2004-08-11  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* TkAstroCatalog/AstroCatalog.pm: Add demo Catalog browser for Tk

	* Catalog.pm: Add auto_filter_observability

	* IO/JCMT.pm: Publish a method for cleaning the target name (so
	  that the JCMT VAX control system will not get upset) and use that
	  method in the JCMT catalog writer (so that a "use this target"
	  message) is guaranteed to agree with the name in the catalogue.

2004-05-20  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 3.7.0)

        * Updated documentation ready for release.
          
2004-03-02  Brad Cavanagh  <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Added Query/MPC support along with associated test harness.

2004-03-01  Brad Cavanagh  <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* IO/VOTable: added support for parallax and proper motions.
	
2004-02-25  Brad Cavanagh  <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Catalog.pm: added fielddate method.

	* Star/Star.pm: added insertdate method.

2004-02-05  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

        * Added STL support (read only) as a pluggable IO module
          along with associated test harness.

2003-11-14  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 3.5.2)

        * README: Updated location of VOTable module package, which
          moved. 

2003-10-30  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 3.5.1)

        * IO/Cluster.pm: Added read support for new style character
          quality flags. Cluster files are still written using the
          old style numeric flags.
          
2003-10-17  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 3.5.0)

        * IO/VOTable.pm: Very simple VOTable reader added, should
          now get at least basic information into the Astro::Catalog
          object if it is passed a VOTable.
          
        * t/2_votable.t: Added test harness for reading VOTables.  

        * Minor documenation cleanup in various files, no actual
          functionality changes.
          
2003-10-16  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 3.4.0)

        * IO/VOTable.pm: Fixed VOTable output to actually have some
          meta-data, now readable by treeview. Added DEFINITIONS
          element to the table and filled in various "default"
          meta-data. The tables are not bogus, but the epoch and
          equinoxes may be incorrect in some cases (SuperCOSMOS
          catalogues for instance).
          
2003-10-13  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 3.3.0)

        * Added VOTable support (write only) as a pluggable IO module
          along with associated test harness.
          
2003-09-30  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Query/Query/Sesame.pm: Modified to cope with change in return
          format by CDS. 
                  
2003-09-24  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Query/Query/SIMBAD.pm: Removed debugging statements which 
          generated a file containing a copy of the retrieved HTML in 
          the current working directory.
               
        * etc/sss.cfg: Added SkyCat SuperCOSMOS configuration file to 
          default distribution
        
        * etc/skycat.cfg: Added generic SkyCat configuration file to 
          default distribution   

        * Query/Query/SkyCat.pm: Updated to look for $PERLPREFIX/etc/skycat.cfg
          configuration file by default.
               
        * Makefile.PL: Modified makefile to install the SkyCat configuration
          files to $(PERLPREFIX)/etc in preperation for shifting access to
          SuperCOSMOS from being dependant on Astro::Aladin to using the
          Astro::Catalog::Query::SkyCat module. 
          
        * Query/Query/SuperCOSMOS.pm: Totally reimplemented this module
          from scratch to use the SkyCat.pm module rather than relying
          on the Astro::Aladin implementation. 

        * t/4_skycat_supercos.t: Added a test suite for the new SuperCOSMOS
          module. This superceedes the older 4_supercos.t test suite.

        * MANIFEST: Updated to reflect the actual package, we've been shipping
          V3.x with bits missing since release, whoops!
        
        * old/*: Moved some of the non-functional test suite into a this
          directory along with the old Astro::Aladin SuperCOSMOS module. 
           
2003-09-24  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Query/Query/CMC.pm: Added a Vizier Carlsberg Meridian Catalogue
          (CMC/11) query sub-class to try and figure out how Tim had written 
          the 2MASS (Vizier generic) class. RA & Dec incorrect.

        * Query/Query/2MASS.pm: Moved colour generation for 2MASS catalogue
          from the more generic IO/TST.pm module.
        
        * IO/TST.pm: See changes to Query/Query/2MASS.pm
        
2003-09-12  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Query/Query/Sesame.pm: Modified to cope with change in return
          format by CDS.

        * Query/Query/USNOA2.pm: Fixed problem with USNO-A2 having bogus
          RA and Dec seconds fields (= 60.0) which breaks Astro::Catalog.
          The query module now silently discards these objects (for now!).

        * Query/Query/GSC.pm: Fixed problem with GSC which dropped the
          B magnitude error into the quality flag. Fix breaks the t/4_gsc.t 
          test harness.
        
        * Catalog.pm: Changed default origin of <UNKNOWN> to UNKNOWN to
          avoid parsing problems when the results of a query are displayed
          as part of an HTML page.
                     
2003-08-26  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Star/Star.pm: Modified quality() routine so it knows about
          TST quality flags. Not a particularly good solution, need to
          generalise this and move it to the IO::TST module.
          
        * IO/Cluster.pm: Moved id() changes for USNO-A2 to generic code
          in the pluggable IO module
          
        * IO/TST.pm: Modified to generate colours and quality flags for 2MASS  

2003-08-03  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * IO/Cluster.pm: Fiddled with the quality flags for Cluster output,
          to get rid of an uninitalised value warning. Still need to go to
          character quality flags.
          
        * Query/Query/USNOA2.pm: Changed the id() of the downloaded USNO-A2
          stars to be numberic, otherwise we break the cluster format which
          requires numeric id's. Also tweaked the $catalog->pushstar() line
          so if the Astro::Coords object in the Astro::Catalog::Star object
          is broken (bogus dec?) its not going to get included in the catalog.
        
2003-08-03  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Query/Query/SIMBAD.pm: All the functionality of Astro::SIMBAD
  	  integrated into Astro::Catalog... 

	* Star/Star.pm: Add startype, spectype, longstartype and moreinfo
	  needed by SIMBAD query.

2003-08-02  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Transport/*.pm: Reorganized as part of SkyCat work 

	* Query/Query/*.pm: All Query classes reorganised to make SkyCat
	  easier. 

	* Query/Query.pm: Much reorganization to support SkyCat class. 

	* Query/Query/SkyCat.pm: Now forms a query and parses the results
	  for an abritrary SkyCat-enabled server. Still not ready for prime
	  time.

	* t/4_*.t: All query tests now use helper.pl
	
	* t/helper.pl: Reusable test components now in separate file 

2003-08-01  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Transport/REST.pm (useragent): Instantiate useragent on demand
	  rather than via configure (useful for skycat interface). Separate
	  construction of URL from retrieval of URL to allow simpler
          subclassing.

2003-07-30  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* IO/TST.pm: Add TST format reader. Still has debug.

2003-07-29  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Moved Astro::Catalog::BaseQuery to be Astro::Catalog::Query in
          preparation for it be a proper polymorphic factory class for
          generic catalogue queries.
        
        * Moved actualy query sub-classes down a directory level to allow
          for the Query.pm file 
          
        * Added a WebService transport class, probably needs some added
          generalisation, but our sample of web services is still small.
          
        * Added a Sesame.pm class to do CDS Sesame lookups by target name
          using the new WebService transport class. 
                       
2003-07-28  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Moved the catalogue query classes to chare a common namespace,
          current classes now inherit from the Astro::Catalog::Transport::REST
          class. While future web and GRID service classes will inherit from
          related classes. All the Astro::Catalog::Transport classes inherit
          from Tim's BaseQuery class.
          
        * Moved REST specific setup from BaseQuery to Transport::REST class  

        * t/*.t: Test scripts modified to work within new framework.
        
        * t/1_compile.t: Now chekc for presence of Astro::Aladin module
        
2003-07-27  Tim Jenness <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

        * Added sorting and filtering of catalogues.

2003-07-26  Tim Jenness <timj@jach.hawaii.edu> 
            & Alasdiar Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>
            
        * Added pluggable IO.
            
2003-07-24  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * t/catalog.t: Tests fixed to reflect the new two decimal place
          precisions generated by using Astro::Coords objects
          
2003-07-24  Tim Jenness <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* BaseQuery/BaseQuery.pm: Write base class for catalog query classes.

	* Catalog.pm (_read_cluster): No longer use ra() and dec() methods
	  to set the ra and dec (store the Astro::Coords object directly)

	* Star/Star.pm: ra($ra) and dec($dec) methods now deprecated.

        * t/1_compile.t: New tests addded.
        
2003-07-23  Tim Jenness <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Star/Star.pm: Now uses Astro::Coords internally.

	* Catalog.pm: Now uses Astro::Coords internally. Switch to lexical
	  filehandles.

2003-07-19  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (version 2.1.3)

        * Catalog.pm: added patch by Brad Cavanagh to popstarbyid()
        
2003-07-15  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (version 2.1.2)

        * Minor documentation tweaks
        
        * Added some example scripts to the distribution
          
2003-06-10  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Catalog.pm: Fixed bug in new _read_cluster() routine for
          instances where we're reading from a file.
          
2003-06-09  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Fixed test scripts for Astro::Catalog::SuperCOSMOS so that
          they fail gracefully if Astro::Aladin isn't installed.
          
        * Astro::Catalog module patched to take an ARK catalogue via
          a scalar rather than from a file. For backwards compatibility
          reasons Astro::Catalog( Cluster => $file ) still refers to
          a serialised version, whereas Astro::Catalog( Scalar => $file ) 
          refers to a scalar holding a string that is an ARK Cluster
          catalogue. This isn't optimal but I don't particularly want
          to break the exisiting (extensive) codebase.

2003-02-24  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Astro::Catalog now wraps SuperCOSMOS catalogue using 
          the Astro::Aladin module. Some example scripts using this
          new module and the Astro::DSS module are included in the
          distribution. NB: This isn't intended to be used seriously
          by anyone, its not even a sub-optimal way of going about
          things, but I was playing and since I wrote the code I may
          as well distribute the stuff.
          
2002-05-31  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Removed references to Math::libm from the GSC modules, these
          references seemed to have been missed by the previous patch.
          
2002-05-29  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Applied patch provided by Stephen Quiney <S.J.Quinney@durham.ac.uk>,
          removes dependancy on Math::libm and fixes test script problem
          which required the $ESTAR_DATA environment variable to be set.

2002-03-30  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Minor bug fix?

2002-03-29  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>
        
        * Added a freeze() function so that the the Catalog object can be
          stored persistently using the Data::Dumper module
          
2002-01-24  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Various changes made to support the Field Correlation Client,
          note that the USNO-A2 parsing was broken for catalogues with
          more than 1000 stars before this update.

2002-01-14  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Catalog.pm: Can now read from, and dump to, ARK Cluster files.

2002-01-13  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Generic Catalog and Star objects working, lacks way to parse
          ARK format Cluster files into Astro::Catalog objects, but all
          other functionality in place.
          
2002-01-10  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Original version.
