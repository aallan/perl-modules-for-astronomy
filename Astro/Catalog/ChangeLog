        * Moved Astro::Catalog::BaseQuery to be Astro::Catalog::Query in
          preparation for it be a 'proprt' polymorphic factory class for
          generic catalogue queries.
        
        * Moved actualy query sub-classes down a directory level to allow
          for the Query.pm file  
          
2003-07-28  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Moved the catalogue query classes to chare a common namespace,
          current classes now inherit from the Astro::Catalog::Transport::REST
          class. While future web and GRID service classes will inherit from
          related classes. All the Astro::Catalog::Transport classes inherit
          from Tim's BaseQuery class.
          
        * Moved REST specific setup from BaseQuery to Transport::REST class  

        * t/*.t: Test scripts modified to work within new framework.
        
        * t/1_compile.t: Now chekc for presence of Astro::Aladin module
        
2003-07-27  Tim Jenness <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

        * Added sorting and filtering of catalogues.

            & Alasdiar Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>
            
        * Added pluggable IO.
            
2003-07-24  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * t/catalog.t: Tests fixed to reflect the new two decimal place
          precisions generated by using Astro::Coords objects
          
2003-07-24  Tim Jenness <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* BaseQuery/BaseQuery.pm: Write base class for catalog query classes.

	* Catalog.pm (_read_cluster): No longer use ra() and dec() methods
	to set the ra and dec (store the Astro::Coords object directly)

	* Star/Star.pm: ra($ra) and dec($dec) methods now deprecated.

        * t/1_compile.t: New tests addded.
        
2003-07-23  Tim Jenness <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Star/Star.pm: Now uses Astro::Coords internally.

	* Catalog.pm: Now uses Astro::Coords internally. Switch to lexical
	  filehandles.

2003-07-19  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (version 2.1.3)

        * Catalog.pm: added patch by Brad Cavanagh to popstarbyid()
        
2003-07-15  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (version 2.1.2)

        * Minor documentation tweaks
        
        * Added some example scripts to the distribution
          
2003-06-10  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Catalog.pm: Fixed bug in new _read_cluster() routine for
          instances where we're reading from a file.
          
2003-06-09  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Fixed test scripts for Astro::Catalog::SuperCOSMOS so that
          they fail gracefully if Astro::Aladin isn't installed.
          
        * Astro::Catalog module patched to take an ARK catalogue via
          a scalar rather than from a file. For backwards compatibility
          reasons Astro::Catalog( Cluster => $file ) still refers to
          a serialised version, whereas Astro::Catalog( Scalar => $file ) 
          refers to a scalar holding a string that is an ARK Cluster
          catalogue. This isn't optimal but I don't particularly want
          to break the exisiting (extensive) codebase.

2003-02-24  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Astro::Catalog now wraps SuperCOSMOS catalogue using 
          the Astro::Aladin module. Some example scripts using this
          new module and the Astro::DSS module are included in the
          distribution. NB: This isn't intended to be used seriously
          by anyone, its not even a sub-optimal way of going about
          things, but I was playing and since I wrote the code I may
          as well distribute the stuff.
          
2002-05-31  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Removed references to Math::libm from the GSC modules, these
          references seemed to have been missed by the previous patch.
          
2002-05-29  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Applied patch provided by Stephen Quiney <S.J.Quinney@durham.ac.uk>,
          removes dependancy on Math::libm and fixes test script problem
          which required the $ESTAR_DATA environment variable to be set.

2002-03-30  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Minor bug fix?

2002-03-29  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>
        
        * Added a freeze() function so that the the Catalog object can be
          stored persistently using the Data::Dumper module
          
2002-01-24  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Various changes made to support the Field Correlation Client,
          note that the USNO-A2 parsing was broken for catalogues with
          more than 1000 stars before this update.

2002-01-14  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Catalog.pm: Can now read from, and dump to, ARK Cluster files.

2002-01-13  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Generic Catalog and Star objects working, lacks way to parse
          ARK format Cluster files into Astro::Catalog objects, but all
          other functionality in place.
          
2002-01-10  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Original version.
