=head1 NAME

Astro::Catalog::Query::SkyCat - Generate SkyCat catalogue query clients

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

On load, automatically parse the SkyCat server specification file
from C<~/.skycat/skycat.cfg>, if available, and dynamically 
generate query classes that can send queries to each catalog
server and parse the results.

my %CONFIG;

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Constructor

=item B<new>

Simple constructor. Forces read of config file if one can be found and
the config has not been read previously. If no config file can be located
the query object can not be instantiated since it will not know the
location of any servers.

 $q = new Astro::Catalog::Query::SkyCat( catalog => 'gsc', %options );
 $q = new Astro::Catalog::Query::SkyCat( catalog => 'gsc@eso', %options );

The C<catalog> field must be present, otherwise the new object will
not know which remote server to use and which options are mandatory
in the query. Note that the remote catalog can not be changed after
the object is instantiated. In general it is probably not wise to
try to change the remote host via either the C<query_url> or
C<url> methods unless you know what you are doing. Modifying your
C<skycat.cfg> file is safer.

Currently only one config file is supported at any given time.
If a config file is changed (see the C<cfg_file> class method)
the current config is overwritten automatically.

It is not possible to override the catalog file in the 
constructor. Use the C<cfg_file> class method instead.

Obviously a config per object can be supported but this is
probably not that helpful. This will be reconsidered if demand
is high.

These methods are not associated with any particular object.

=item B<cfg_file>

Location of the skycat config file. Default location is
C<$SKYCAT_CFG>, if defined, else C<$HOME/.skycat/skycat.cfg>.

This could be made per-class if there is a demand for running
queries with different catalogs. This would also move the config
contents into the query object itself.

Method to load the skycat config information into
the class and configure the modules.

  $q->_load_config() or die "Error loading config";

The config file name is obtained from the C<cfg_file> method.
Returns true if the file was read successfully and contained at
least one catalog server. Otherwise returns false.

Requires an object to attach itself to (mainly for the useragent
remote directory follow up). The results of this load are
visible to all instances of this class.

Usually called automatically from the constructor if a config
has not previously been read.

=item B<_extract_raw_info>

Go through a skycat.cfg file and extract the raw unprocessed entries
into an array of hashes. The actual content of the file is passed
in as a reference to an array of lines.

This routine is separate from the main load routine to allow recursive

If the supplied hash reference has content, look at the content
and decide whether you simply want to keep that content or 
follow up directory specifications by doing a remote URL call
and expanding that directory specification to many more remote
catalogue server configs.

 @configs = $q->_dir_check( \%current );

Returns the supplied argument, additional configs derived from
that argument or nothing at all.

Do not follow a 'directory' link if we have already followed a link with
the same short name. This prevents infinite recursion when the catalog
pointed to by 'catalogs@eso' itself contains a reference to 'catalogs@eso'.

list context returns the lines in a list.

If we have an error retrieving the file, just return an empty

=head1 NOTES

'directory' entries are not followed by default although the class
can be configured to do so by setting 

 $Astro::Catalog::Query::SkyCat::FOLLOW_DIRS = 1;

to true.

This class could simply read the catalog config file and allow queries
on explicit servers directly rather than going to the trouble of
auto-generating a class per server. This has the advantage of allowing
a user to request USNO data from different servers rather than generating
a single USNO class. ie

  my $q = new Astro::Catalog::Query::SkyCat( catalog => 'usnoa@eso',
                                             target => 'HL Tau',
                                             radius => 5 );

as opposed to

    my $q = new Astro::Catalog::Query::USNOA( target => 'HL Tau',
                                              radius => 5 );

What to do with catalogue mirrors is an open question. Of course,
convenience wrapper classes could be made available that simply delegate
the calls to the SkyCat class.

=head1 BUGS

At the very least for testing, an up-to-date skycat.cfg file
should be distributed with this module. Whether it should be
used by this module once installed is an open question (since
many people will not have a version in the standard location).
