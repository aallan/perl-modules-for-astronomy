Astro::Catalog module
---------------------

What is it?
-----------

The module is a generic object orientated astronomical catalogue object.

Version 3.0
-----------

Verison 3.0 of the Astro::Catalog breaks the existing v1.x and v2.x API. There
are many good reasons for this, chiefly the introduction of new features that
would have been hard to implement and maintain backwards compatibility.

New features for v3.0 include pluggable I/O support, filtering and inline
sorting of retrieved catalogues. However alot of the improvements are not 
readily noticable by the user as alot of work has gone into the infrastructure
of the package. This means that adding additional I/O and Query support has 
been made alot easier.

Requirements
------------

The madatory requirement of the Astro::Catalog package are,
 
  Astro::Coords
  Astro::Telescope
  Astro::SLA
  Time::Piece
  File::Spec
  Math::Libm
  Net::Domain
  LWP::UserAgent
  SOAP::Lite
  Test
  Test::More
  Data::Dumper
  Carp
  
Additionally,if you wish to use the Astro::Catalog::Query::SuperCOSMOS
module, the package requires that the Astro::Aladin module (and associated
CDS Java Aladin infrastructure) are installed.

Provides
--------

The package provides the following user level classes

  Astro::Catalog
    A generic catalogue object, includes pluggable I/O support.
  
  Astro::Catalog::Star
    A generic catalogue item.
    
  Astro::Catalog::Query::USNOA2
    A class to automatically retrieves a objects in the USNO-A2.0 catalogue
    matching query parameters and returns an Astro::Catalog object. 

  Astro::Catalog::Query::GSC
    A class to automatically retrieves a objects in the GSC catalogue
    matching query parameters and returns an Astro::Catalog object.
 
  Astro::Catalog::Query::2MASS
   A class to automatically retrieves a objects in the 2MASS catalogue
   matching query parameters and returns an Astro::Catalog object.
        
  Astro::Catalog::Query::SuperCOSMOS
    A class to automatically retrieves a objects in the SuperCOSMOS catalogue
    matching query parameters and returns an Astro::Catalog object. 
    
  Astro::Catalog::Query::Sesame
    A class that does a name lookup using the CDS Sesame Web Service and
    returns an Astro::Catalog object containing a single Astro::Catalog::Star
    object.
    
  Astro::Catalog::Query::SIMBAD
    A class that does an object lookup on CDS SIMBAD, implements most of
    the functionaliy of the Astro::SIMBAD module.
     
  Astro::Catalog::Query::SkyCat
    A class that generates SkyCat catalogue queries
    
  Astro::Catalog::Query::Vizier  
    A class that generates Vizier catalogue queries

Additional classes provided by the package handle things that you don't
need to concern yourself with, unless you want to write your own I/O or
query plugins, these are

  Astro::Catalog::IO::Cluster
  Astro::Catalog::IO::JCMT
  Astro::Catalog::IO::Simple
  Astro::Catalog::IO::TST
  Astro::Catalog::Transport::REST
  Astro::Catalog::Transport::WebService
  Astro::Catalog::Query

The user level query classes inherit from the Astro::Catalog::Transport::XXX
classes, which in turn all inherit basic functionality from the Query base
class Astro::Catalog::Query. The Astro::Catalog::IO modules provide pluggable
polymorphic input/output.
 
Where can I get it?
-------------------

The package is availabe from CPAN <http://www.cpan.org/> and from the 
eSTAR Project at http://www.estar.org.uk/

Installation
------------

Installation is automated using the ExtUtils::MakeMaker library

     % perl Makefile.PL
     % make
     % make test
     % make install

Authors
-------

The module was originally written by Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>,
of the University of Exeter Astrophysics Group (http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/)  
as part of his work for the eSTAR project.

The internal architecture of the module has been extensively rewritten 
for v3.0 by Tim Jenness <t.jenness@jach.hawaii.edu> of the Joint Astronomy
Centre in Hawaii and Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>, of the University 
of Exeter Astrophysics Group

This version also includes patches supplied by Stephen Quinney
<S.J.Quinney@durham.ac.uk> of Durham University, and Brad Cavanagh
<b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu> of the Joint Astronomy Centre in Hawaii.
