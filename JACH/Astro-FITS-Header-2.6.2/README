Astro::FITS::Header module
--------------------------  

What is it?
-----------
Astro::FITS::Header and associated sub-classes are tools for reading,
modifying and then writing out FITS standard header blocks to FITS, NDF 
and GSD files. The module now fully supports ESO HIERARCH header keywords.

Full documentation is included in the POD attached to the modules.

Tied Interface
--------------
This is a warning for those of you using the tied interface from previous
version of the module. The interface now acts very differently, theoretically 
teh changes shouldn't break existing code, but it has diverged sufficiently 
far from the original that I'm no longer convinced that it will work in all
cases. Be warned!

Requirements
------------

The Astro::FITS::Header module can work with FITS Header blocks, either
directly from the primary FITS HDU of a file complying with the FITS data
standard, or from the FITS extension in an extensible N-dimensional data
format (NDF) file or from a Global Section Data file (GSD). Additionally
the module also supports .HEADER in HDS contanier files.

To work with FITS files, the Astro::FITS::Header module requires Pete
Ratzlaff's <pratzlaff@cfa.harvard.edu> Astro::FITS::CFITSIO library
(v 1.01 or greater), which in turn requires William Pence's CFITSIO
subroutine library (v2.430 or greater). It should be noted that to
build the CFITSIO subroutine library on RedHat Linux 7.x you need to
use version 2.202 or above, however the module requires v2.400 at least
to work with the Astro::FITS::CFITSIO module.

For more information on CFITSIO, see http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/

To work with NDF, HDS and GSD files, the Astro::FITS::Header module
requires Tim Jenness' <t.jenness@jach.hawaii.edu> NDF (version 1.42 or
greater)  and GSD modules These modules are installed as part of the
PERLMODS package in the Starlink Software Collection.

For more information on the Starlink Software Collection and the Starlink
Project in general see http://www.starlink.ac.uk/

Provides
--------
The package provides the following classes
	
   Astro::FITS::Header
   Astro::FITS::Header::NDF
   Astro::FITS::Header::CFITSIO
   Astro::FITS::Header::GSD
   
which all include POD format documentation. 

Where can I get it?
-------------------
The package is availabe from CPAN <http://www.cpan.org/> and from
http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/aa/pages/computing/fitsheader.html  

Installation
------------
Installation is automated using the ExtUtils::MakeMaker library

     % perl Makefile.PL
     % make
     % make test
     % make install

If the Astro::FITS::CFITSIO or NDF modules are not installed 'make
test' will detect this and skip the test harness for the relevant
modules with a warning.

Authors
-------
The module was originally written by Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>, of 
the University of Exeter Astrophysics Group (http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/) as 
part of his work for the Starlink Project (http://www.starlink.ac.uk/), and 
Tim Jenness <timj@jach.hawaii.edu> of the Joint Astronomy Center (JAC) 
(http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/) in Hawaii.

This version of the module includes patches supplied by Diab Jerius
<dj@head-cfa.harvard.edu> of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. 

The tied interface was updated for version 2.x by Craig DeForest
<deforest@boulder.swri.edu> of the Department of Space Studies, Southwest
Research Institute and Tim Jenness <timj@jach.hawaii.edu> of the Joint
Astronomy Center (JAC) in Hawaii.
