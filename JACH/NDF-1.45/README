This is version 1.42 of the perl NDF module
-------------------------------------------

The extensible N-dimensional data format (NDF) is a format for storing
bulk data in the form of N-dimensional arrays of numbers. It is
typically used for storing spectra, images and similar datasets with
higher dimensionality. The NDF format is based on the Hierarchical
Data System (HDS) and is extensible; not only does it provide a 
comprehensive set of standard ancillary items to describe the data,
it can also be extended indefinitely to handle additional user-defined
information of any type.

NDF is the data format of choice for software distributed by the
Starlink Project (Rutherford Appleton Laboratory,
http://star-www.rl.ac.uk/). It is widely used in the United Kingdom
astronomical community (for example in the Figaro data reduction
package).

This module provides a perl interface to the Fortran NDF libraries
that are supplied with the standard Starlink software distribution.

PDL
---

The Perl Data Language (PDL) distribution provides a module that can be
used to read NDF files into it. That module (PDL::IO::NDF) requires this
module to be installed.

The PDL module requires at least v1.99 of perldl.
The PDL home page can be found at http://pdl.perl.org/
