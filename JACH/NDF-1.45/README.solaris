Instructions for building the NDF module on Sun Solaris systems
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The NDF perl module can be built as a shareable module or an
ndfperl binary on Solaris.

Note that this module has not been built successfully using gcc (get
errors in /usr/local/lib/perl5/sun4-solaris/5.00402/CORE/scope.h). It
probably won't work since the NDF libraries also require the Sun Fortran
Run-Time-Libraries.
