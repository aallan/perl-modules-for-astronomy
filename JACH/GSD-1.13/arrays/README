ARRAYS.c
--------

This is code written by Karl Glazebrook [kgb@aaoepp.aao.gov.au]
to simplify the handling of numeric arrays in XS files.

Compilation
-----------

You will probably have to change the include directory specified
in the makefile. This must point to the location of perl.h, EXTERN.h
and XSUB.h on your system.

To build just type 'make'

If you simply want to compile this into the NDF module directly,
uncomment the include "arrays/arrays.c" line in NDF.xs. In this case
the library does not need to be built.
