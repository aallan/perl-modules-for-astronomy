	* README: Update for v1.13 

	* GSD.pm: gsdClose now moved back to XS since we no longer need to
	include the kluge that closes the perl filehandle prematurely.

	* GSD.xs: Now treats FILE* as an opaque pointer to prevent
	problems with Perl importing the file handle and then closing
	the file itself.

	* typemap: FILE* is changed to GSDFILE* and is now a T_OPAQUEPTR

	* gsdprint: Properly determine where C13DAT is in order to omit it. 

	* GSD.pm (DESTROY): Use isa() to see if we are a hash since ref()
	always returns that we are a GSD object regardless of whether we
	are a glob or not.

2000-05-11  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* GSD.pm: Add perl level gsdClose

	* GSD.xs: - Now use T_PTROBJ so that file_dsc, item_dsc and
	data_ptr are type checked in each command.
	- gsdInqSize now tidied up to avoid mallocs
        - now use PREINIT blocks rather than static
        - use gsd_data type for data_ptr.
