	* JCMT.pm (writeCatalog): Make sure that we can match the spec
	used by the JCMT where the target name can be 15 characters

	* JCMT.pm (writeCatalog): Correctly remove spaces from the target
	name. Rationalise $name usage.

	* JCMT.pm (_parse_line): Throw an exception if we have an error
	converting a line to an Astro::Coords.

	* JCMT.pm (_parse_line): Separate out the parsing of the lines and
	allow for the catalog to be submitted as a string rather than a
	file name
