Astro::FITS::HdrTrans module
----------------------------

What is it?
-----------
Astro::FITS::HdrTrans and associated sub-classes are tools for translating 
instrument-specific FITS headers into generically named headers.

Requirements
------------
The Astro::FITS::HdrTrans module has minimal requirements on other 
modules; only Switch is required. Instrument-specific sub-classes of 
Astro::FITS::HdrTrans may require other modules to be installed, depending 
on the transformations those sub-classes make. As an example, the 
translation sub-class for IRIS2 (an imaging spectrometer used at the 
Anglo-Australian Telescope) requires Math::Trig in order to do zenith 
distance to airmass translations.

Where can I get it?
-------------------
The package is available from CPAN <http://www.cpan.org/> and from 
http://astro.perl.org/Astro/FITS/HdrTrans/
