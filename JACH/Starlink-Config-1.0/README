This is the Starlink::Config module.
It is used by other modules to determine the location of the
Starlink system.

To install:

  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

On a Starlink system perl is located in /star/Perl/bin. The
configuration file is automatically built during the initial
phase. The Starlink environment is determined by looking at
environment variables.

The location of the starlink system is determined by first looking for
$STARLINK, else $INSTALL else failling back to '/star'. An error is
raised if the Starlink base directory does not actually exist.

See the pod documentation for more information:

   % perldoc Starlink::Config
