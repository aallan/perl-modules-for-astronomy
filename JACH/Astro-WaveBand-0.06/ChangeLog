        * WaveBand.pm: Added three static methods has_instrument(),
          has_filter() and is_observable() which pretty much do exactly
          what it says on the box. Check the inline POD for details.
          Added a %TELESCOPE lookup hash to go along with the existing
          %FILTERS lookup hash.
