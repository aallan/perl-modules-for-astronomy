Astro::WaveBand
===============

This module provides transparent conversion of astronomical filter
names to wavelength and frequency and vice versa.  For example it
knows the wavelengths of the J, H and K near-infrared filters or the
filter names of the SCUBA submm camera.

This software is still in alpha release. It's been used in my
applications but there may be some future API tweaks required as more
telescopes/instruments are included.

Requirements
------------

No other modules are required.
Requires Perl 5.6.0 or newer.

Limitations
-----------

Currently the instrument specific knowledge only covers instruments
at the UKIRT and JCMT telescopes. Please send more instrument details.

Building
--------

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
