This is MIME::Lite 3.01 Maintenance release
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION
    Install using

      perl makefile.pl
      make test
      make install

    Or instead of the last line, even better is

      make install TEST_VERBOSE=1

    Adjust the make command as is appropriate for your OS. 'nmake' is the
    usual name under Win32

    In order to read the docmentation please use

      perldoc MIME::Lite

    from the command line or visit

      http://search.cpan.org/search?query=MIME%3A%3ALite&mode=all

    for a list of all MIME::Lite related materials including the
    documentation in HTML of all of the released versions of MIME::Lite.

BUNDLED GOODIES
    MIME::Lite comes with a number of extra files in the distribution
    bundle. This includes examples, and utility modules that you can use to
    get yourself started with the module.

    The ./examples directory contains a number of snippets in prepared form,
    generally they are documented, but they should be easy to understand.

    The ./contrib directory contains a companion/tool modules that come
    bundled with MIME::Lite, they dont get installed by default. Please
    review the POD they come with.

OTHER MODULES
    MIME::Lite works nicely with other certain other modules if they are present.
    Good to have installed is the latest MIME::Types, Mail::Address MIME::Base64.

BUGS
    The whole reason that version 3.01 was released was to ensure that
    MIME::Lite is up to date and patched. If you find an issue please report
    it.

    As far as I know MIME::Lite doesnt currently have any serious bugs, but
    my usage is hardly comprehensive.

    Having said that there are a number of open issues for me, mostly caused
    by the progress in the community as whole since Eryq last released. The
    tests are based around an interesting but non standard test framework.
    I'd like to change it over to using Test::More.

    Should tests fail please review the ./testout directory, and in any bug
    reports please include the output of the relevent file. This is the only
    redeeming feature of not using Test::More that I can see.

    Bug fixes / Patches / Contribution are welcome, however I probably won't
    apply them unless they also have an associated test. This means that if
    I dont have the time to write the test the patch wont get applied, so
    please, include tests for any patches you provide.
