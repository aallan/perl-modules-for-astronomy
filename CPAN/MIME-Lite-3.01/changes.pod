=head1 CHANGE LOG

=over 4

=item Version 3.01 (2003/04/25)

Eryq has reappeared long enough to graciously hand over the maintaince of the
module to me. Thanks.

=item Version 3.00 (2003/04/24)

Eryq has disappeared. His web site remains but he doesnt answer emails.

I have taken it onto myself to take over maintenance until he returns to
reclaim his excellent work.

I don't intend to develop this in an serious way. I'll patch it if people
have a patch and generally keep it ticking over, but dont expect new features.

This release has code that actually works with MIME::Lite now. As well as a few
other minor additions (like a test for this functionailty)

For stuff that could be done, a first place would be to rewrite and extend the
test suite. It should use Test::More or Test::Builder at the very least.

I also might rip out the preformatted doc pages. It makes the distro way fatter
than it needs to be. I reckon the package contains the POD in at least three forms.
A wee tad overkill I think. :-)

=item Version 2.117   (2001/08/20)

The terms-of-use have been placed in the distribution file "COPYING".  
Also, small documentation tweaks were made.


=item Version 2.116   (2001/08/17)

Added long-overdue patch which makes the instance method form
of send() do the right thing when given HOW... arguments.
I<Thanks to Casey West for the patch.>

=item Version 2.114   (2001/08/16)

New special 'AUTO' content type in new()/build() tells MIME::Lite to 
try and guess the type from file extension.  To make use of 
this, you'll want to install B<MIME::Types>.
The "AUTO" setting can be made the default default (instead of "TEXT")
if you set C<$AUTO_CONTENT_TYPE = 1, $PARANOID = 0>.
I<Thanks to> Ville SkyttE<#228> I<for these patches.>

File::Basename is used if it is available.
I<Thanks to> Ville SkyttE<#228> I<for this patch.>

SMTP failures (in send_by_smtp) now add the $smtp-E<gt>message to the
croak'ed exception, so if things go wrong, you get a better
idea of what and why.
I<Thanks to Thomas R. Wyant III for the patch.>

Made a subtle change to C<as_string> which supposedly fixes a 
failed MIME data.t test with Perl 5.004_04 on NT 4 sp6.  
The problem might only exist in this old perl, but as the patch 
author says, not everyone has climbed higher on the Perl ladder.
I<Thanks to John Gotts for the patch.>

Added C<contrib> directory, with F<MailTool.pm>.
I<Thanks to Tom Wyant for this contribution.>

Improved HTML documentation (notice the links to
the individual methods in the top menu).

Corrected some mis-docs.


=item Version 2.111   (2001/04/03)

Added long-overdue C<parts()> and C<parts_DFS()> methods.

    No instance method
       For accessing the subparts?			   
    That can't be right.  D'OH!		 

Added long-overdue auto-verify logic to C<print()> method.

Added long-overdue C<preamble()> method for getting/setting 
the preamble text.  
I<Thanks to Jim Daigle for inspiring this.>


=item Version 2.108   (2001/03/30)

New C<field_order()> allows you to set the header order, both on a 
per-message basis, and package-wide.
I<Thanks to Thomas Stromberg for suggesting this.>

Added code to try and divine "sendmail" path more intelligently.
I<Thanks to Slaven Rezic for the suggestion.>


=item Version 2.107   (2001/03/27)

Fixed serious bug where tainted data with quoted-printable encoding
was causing infinite loops.  The "fix" untaints the data in question,
which is not optimal, but it's probably benign in this case.
I<Thanks to Stefan Sautter for tracking this nasty little beast down.>
I<Thanks to Larry Geralds for a related patch.>

    "Doctor, O doctor:
       it's painful when I do *this* --" 
    "Simple: don't *do* that." 

Fixed bugs where a non-local C<$_> was being modified... again!  
Will I never learn?
I<Thanks to Maarten Koskamp for reporting this.>

    Dollar-underscore
       can poison distant waters;
   'local' must it be.

Fixed buglet in C<add()> where all value references were being treated
as arrayrefs, instead of as possibly-self-stringifying object refs.
Now you can send in an object ref as the 2nd argument.
I<Thanks to dLux for the bug report.>

    That ref is a string?
       Operator overload
    has ruined my day.

Added "Approved" as an acceptable header field for C<new()>, as per RFC1036.
I<Thanks to Thomax for the suggestion regarding MIME-tools.>

Small improvements to docs to make different uses of attach() 
and various arguments clearer.
I<Thanks to Sven Rassman and Roland Walter for the suggestions.>


=item Version 2.106   (2000/11/21)

Added Alpha version of scrub() to make it easy for people to suppress
the printing of unwanted MIME attributes (like Content-length).
I<Thanks to the many people who asked for this.>

Headers with empty-strings for their values are no longer
printed.  This seems sensible, and helps us implement scrub().


=item Version 2.105   (2000/10/14)

The regression-test failure was identified, and it was my fault.
Apparently some of the \-quoting in my "autoloaded" code was
making Perl 5.6 unhappy.  For this nesting-related idiocy, 
a nesting kaiku.
I<Thanks to Scott Schwartz for identifying the problem.>

    In a pattern, my
       backslash-s dwells peacefully,
    unambiguous --
     
       but I embed it
          in a double-quoted string    
       doubling the backslash --
     
          interpolating
             that same double-quoted string 
          in other patterns --
           
             and, worlds within worlds,
                I single-quote the function
             to autoload it -- 
    
          changing the meaning
       of the backslash and the 's';
    and Five-Point-Six growls.


=item Version 2.104   (2000/09/28)

Now attempts to load and use Mail::Address for parsing email 
addresses I<before> falling back to our own method.
I<Thanks to numerous people for suggesting this.>

    Parsing addresses
       is too damn hard. One last hope:
    Let Graham Barr do it!

For the curious, the version of Mail::Address appears 
as the "A" number in the X-Mailer:

    X-Mailer: MIME::Lite 2.104  (A1.15; B2.09; Q2.03)

Added B<FromSender> option to send_by_sendmail().
I<Thanks to Bill Moseley for suggesting this feature.>


=item Version 2.101   (2000/06/06)

Major revision to print_body() and body_as_string() so that
"body" really means "the part after the header", which is what most
people would want in this context.  This is B<not> how it was used
1.x, where "body" only meant "the body of a simple singlepart".
Hopefully, this change will solve many problems and create very few ones.  

Added support for attaching a part to a "message/rfc822", treating
the "message" type as a multipart-like container.

Now takes care not to include "Bcc:" in header when using send_by_smtp,
as a safety precaution against qmail's behavior.
I<Thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa for identifying this problem.>

Improved efficiency of many stringifying operations by using 
string-arrays which are joined, instead of doing multiple appends 
to a scalar.

Cleaned up the "examples" directory.


=item Version 1.147   (2000/06/02)

Fixed buglet where lack of Cc:/Bcc: was causing extract_addrs
to emit "undefined variable" warnings.  Also, lack of a "To:" field
now causes a croak.
I<Thanks to David Mitchell for the bug report and suggested patch.>


=item Version 1.146   (2000/05/18)

Fixed bug in parsing of addresses; please read the WARNINGS section
which describes recommended address formats for "To:", "Cc:", etc.
Also added automatic inclusion of a UT "Date:" at top level unless 
explicitly told not to.
I<Thanks to Andy Jacobs for the bug report and the suggestion.>

=item Version 1.145   (2000/05/06)

Fixed bug in encode_7bit(): a lingering C</e> modifier was removed.
I<Thanks to Michael A. Chase for the patch.>


=item Version 1.142   (2000/05/02)

Added new, taint-safe invocation of "sendmail", one which also
sets up the C<-f> option.  Unfortunately, I couldn't make this automatic:
the change could have broken a lot of code out there which used 
send_by_sendmail() with unusual "sendmail" variants.  
So you'll have to configure "send" to use the new mechanism:

    MIME::Lite->send('sendmail');       ### no args!

I<Thanks to Jeremy Howard for suggesting these features.>


=item Version 1.140   (2000/04/27)

Fixed bug in support for "To", "Cc", and "Bcc" in send_by_smtp():
multiple (comma-separated) addresses should now work fine.
We try real hard to extract addresses from the flat text strings.
I<Thanks to John Mason for motivating this change.>

Added automatic verification that attached data files exist,
done immediately before the "send" action is invoked.
To turn this off, set $MIME::Lite::AUTO_VERIFY to false.

=item Version 1.137   (2000/03/22)

Added support for "Cc" and "Bcc" in send_by_smtp().
To turn this off, set $MIME::Lite::AUTO_CC to false.
I<Thanks to Lucas Maneos for the patch, and tons of others for 
the suggestion.>

Chooses a better default content-transfer-encoding if the content-type
is "image/*", "audio/*", etc.
To turn this off, set $MIME::Lite::AUTO_ENCODE to false.
I<Thanks to many folks for the suggestion.>

Fixed bug in QP-encoding where a non-local C<$_> was being modified.
I<Thanks to Jochen Stenzel for finding this very obscure bug!>

Removed references to C<$`>, C<$'>, and C<$&> (bad variables
which slow things down).

Added an example of how to send HTML files with enclosed in-line
images, per popular demand.


=item Version 1.133   (1999/04/17)

Fixed bug in "Data" handling: arrayrefs were not being handled
properly.


=item Version 1.130   (1998/12/14)

Added much larger and more-flexible send() facility.
I<Thanks to Andrew McRae (and Optimation New Zealand Ltd) 
for the Net::SMTP interface.  Additional thanks to the many folks
who requested this feature.>

Added get() method for extracting basic attributes.

New... "t" tests!


=item Version 1.124   (1998/11/13)

Folded in filehandle (FH) support in build/attach.
I<Thanks to Miko O'Sullivan for the code.>


=item Version 1.122   (1998/01/19)

MIME::Base64 and MIME::QuotedPrint are used if available.

The 7bit encoding no longer does "escapes"; it merely strips 8-bit characters.


=item Version 1.121   (1997/04/08)

Filename attribute is now no longer ignored by build().
I<Thanks to Ian Smith for finding and patching this bug.>


=item Version 1.120   (1997/03/29)

Efficiency hack to speed up MIME::Lite::IO_Scalar.
I<Thanks to David Aspinwall for the patch.>


=item Version 1.116   (1997/03/19)

Small bug in our private copy of encode_base64() was patched.
I<Thanks to Andreas Koenig for pointing this out.>

New, prettier way of specifying mail message headers in C<build()>.

New quiet method to turn off warnings.

Changed "stringify" methods to more-standard "as_string" methods.


=item Version 1.112   (1997/03/06)

Added C<read_now()>, and C<binmode()> method for our non-Unix-using brethren: 
file data is now read using binmode() if appropriate.
I<Thanks to Xiangzhou Wang for pointing out this bug.>


=item Version 1.110   (1997/03/06)

Fixed bug in opening the data filehandle.


=item Version 1.102   (1997/03/01)

Initial release.


=item Version 1.101   (1997/03/01)

Baseline code.
Originally created: 11 December 1996.  Ho ho ho.
