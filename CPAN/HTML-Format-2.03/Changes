   Release 2.03 -- minor bugfix
   The lack of \plain's in HTML::FormatRTF's output was confusing some
   formatters.  Fixed.

   Release 2.02 -- minor bugfix

   No big bug reports on the previous version, so maybe it's not so
   experimental after all!

   Changed the set_version_tag method in HTML::Formatter to avoid some
   undef warnings that "James W. Durkin" <jwd@phonogram.net> found.
