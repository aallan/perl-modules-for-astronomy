*** IMPORTANT ***

* change varlist() to varhash()


AppConfig::State

* Perhaps allow a callback to be installed which is called *instead* of
  the get() and set() methods (or rather, is called by them).

* CASE sensitivity may be required on a per-operation basis.  E.g. CASE
  sensitive for AppConfig::Args but CASE insensitive for AppConfig::File.

* AppConfig::State may need to have CMDARG re-introduced.  When using
  blocks, it will be considerably more convenient to say '-v' rather
  than -block_verbose.  The global CMDARG could be a template of the
  form '%c', to indicate the first character, for example.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------

General

* Change _pedantic() and _debug() calls in AppConfig::* constructors
  to direct $state->{ XXX } lookups.  We are friends, after all and
  the current approach is likely to be rather inefficient.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test Suite

* Modify file expansion tests to determine if getpwnam() etc are working
  or not.
