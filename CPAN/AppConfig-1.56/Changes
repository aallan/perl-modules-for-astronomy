#========================================================================
# Version 1.56  Date: 2004/02/04
#========================================================================

* Applied a patch from Jianhong Feng to add "heredoc" style quoting.

* Applied patch from Dave Viner to AppConfig::Sys to fix problems on
  Win32.  Thanks also to Ijon Tichy for a similar patch.

* Applied patch from Axel Gerstmair to prevent undefined variable
  warnings in block.t test.


#========================================================================
# Version 1.55  Date: 2003/04/29
#========================================================================

* Fixed version numbers of various files which had got out-of-step
  with CPAN.


#========================================================================
# Version 1.54  Date: 2003/04/29
#========================================================================

* Added POSIX style '=value' suffixes to --parameters.  Thus '--foo=bar'
  is now equivalent to '-foo bar'.

* Added AppConfig::CGI module to parse CGI script parameters.

* Added cgi() delegate method to AppConfig to instantiate and call
  AppConfig::CGI.  

* Added CGI documentation and cleaned up copious typos, grammos and
  thinkos.

* Applied documentation patches from Tim Mooney.

* Fixed missing '>' tyop which caused POD to complain.  Thanks to 
  David Cantrell and many others for reporting it.

* Applied patch from Steven McDowall to provide default options
  for LIST and HASH data types.

* Applied patch from Robert Goff to allow '$' to be escaped (e.g. \$)
  to suppress variable expansion in files. 

* Applied patch from John Salmon to allow comments to appear anywhere
  on a line, not just at the beginning.


#========================================================================
# Version 1.53  Date: not released
#========================================================================

* various changes, incorporated above.


#========================================================================
# Version 1.52  Date: 1998/10/29 11:44:23  Author: abw
#========================================================================

* Modified AppConfig::Getopt to work with Getopt::Long version 2.17,
  instead of the yet-to-be-released-as-of-29-Oct-1998 version 2.93
  (3.00 beta).  Getopt::Long version 3.00 offers object-orientation
  but will continue to be backwardly compatible with earlier versions.
  Thus, AppConfig::Getopt should continue with future versions of
  Getopt::Long.  Nice one, Johan!

* Added code to AppConfig::State::define() to handle the compact format.
  The ALIAS and ARGS options are extracted from it and the ARGCOUNT 
  is determined from the ARGS parameter.

* Added Getopt::Long version 2.17 as a dependency in Makefile.PL.
  Added documentation to note this and explain how to modify the 
  Makefile.PL to avoid this check.

* Added t/compact.t and expanded t/getopt.t test files.

* Added documentation for AppConfig::Getopt use and the compact definition
  format.

* Added documentation for +/- prefix format in configuration files.

* Other minor documentation fixes.


#========================================================================
# Version 1.51  Date: 1998/10/22 09:22:53  Author: abw
#========================================================================

* Added '+variable' (set on) and '-variable' (reset to 0 or default)
  syntax for configuration files, as suggested by Chip Salzenberg.

* Fixed auto-creation of variables that was generating two warning 
  messages each time.

* Removed some straggling references to the AppConfig::Const module. 

* Changed Makefile.PL to explicitly list MAN3PODS for all AppConfig::*
  modules.  ExtUtils::MakeMaker ignores files that match the pattern 
  /(config|setup).*\.pm/i;  Thanks to Alex Medina for catching that.  


#========================================================================
# Version 1.50  Date: 1998/10/21 09:28:15  Author: abw
#========================================================================

* Completed documentation.

* First public beta release.
