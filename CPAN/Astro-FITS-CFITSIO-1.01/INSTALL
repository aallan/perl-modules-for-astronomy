NOTE: gcc takes a very long time to compile CFITSIO.c (created from
      CFITSIO.xs) with -O2 optimization on ix86. With -O, it takes
      about one tenth the time. This is the explanation for the optimization
      flag below. Use whatever flag you want, of course...

1. Edit Makefile.PL, point LIBS and INC to the location of your cfitsio
   library and include files.

2. perl Makefile.PL OPTIMIZE=-O

3. make

4. make test

5. If you want, compare the output of the testprog/testprog*.pl scripts
   to cfitsio's testprog.c. There is a small shell script (heresy!) -
   runtests - included to make this easier.

6. make install

If compilation fails, please make sure the version of cfitsio you're using
matches that listed in README as a requirement for this version of the
module.

If compilaton succeeds but 'make test' fails due to unresolved symbols, you
should try explicity setting the libcfitsio.a to link to. In Makefile.PL, add
the following key to the WriteMakefile() argument list:

      'MYEXTLIB' => '/path/to/libcfitsio.a',
