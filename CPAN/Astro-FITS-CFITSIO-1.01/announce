Hello again,

A new version of the Perl interface to William Pence's cfitsio
subroutine library is available. For more information on the cfitsio
subroutine library, see http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio

New features in Astro::FITS::CFITSIO 1.01 include:

* Added new cfitsio 2.420 and 2.410 routines:
  fits_flush_buffer
  fits_open_data
  fits_open_image
  fits_open_table
  fits_write_errmark
  fits_clear_errmark
  fits_delete_rowrange
  fits_copy_file
  fits_parse_range
  fits_insert_key

* Implemented older cfitsio routine:
  fits_find_first_row

* Bug fix in this version:
  Utility routine used by fits_read_pix and fits_read_pixnull had
  an invalid array access which could trigger segmentation violations,
  bus errors and various other mischief. Thanks go to Bob Wiegand
  for finding and fixing this problem.
  

You will need at least version 2.420 of the cfitsio library in order
to build this module. Astro::FITS::CFITSIO has been tested on Linux
(ix86 2.4.x, glibc 2.1/2.2) and Solaris (sparc 2.6/2.8) with Perl
5.6.0 and 5.005.
