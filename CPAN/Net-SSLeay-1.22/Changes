Revision history for Perl extension Net::SSLeay.

0.01  Thu Jun 27 03:56:00 1996
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.16
0.02  Trial with SSL.pm name
0.03  Renamed everything Net::SSLeay
0.04  19.7.1996 Fixed some 0.6.1 incompatibilities, namely removed
      #include <ssl_locl.h>, fixed typo in SSL_get_cerificate, fixed
      the return type of the same. --Sampo
1.00  19.6.1998, Sampo Kellomaki <sampo@@_iki.fi>
	- overhauled to SSLeay-0.9.0
	- renamed cat to sslcat
	- added lots of convenience functions, like get_https
	- added couple of X509 routines
	- improved tests and documentation
	- fixed callbacks (but found that old callbacks dont work)
1.01  23.6.1998, Sampo Kellomaki <sampo@@iki_.fi>
	- made Makefile.PL check SSLeay version and to be more CPAN kosher
	- changed build instructions to build outside perl source tree
	- added random number initialization using /dev/urandom (if available)
	- made ssl_write_all accept references, this is more memory efficient
1.02  8.7.1998, Sampo Kellomaki <sampo@@iki._fi>
	- Added SSL_(CTX)?_set_options and associated constants
	- Slight clean-ups
1.03  4.1.1999, Sampo Kellomaki <sampo@@iki._fi>
	- Merged URI encoding patch to make_form
	  from Joe Rhett <jrhett@@navigist._com>
	- changed sslcat, ssl_read_all, ssl_write_all to return error messages
	  as second member of list. Functions continue to behave the old way
	  if scalar return value is used (they check this with wantarray).
	  Change was suggested by Joe Rhett.
	- changed $trace levels so that 0 does not produce any output
	- changed get_https and put_https to fake error 900 in $response
	  return field
	- changed print_errs and some other internals to return textual
	  errors instead of error count
	- changed SSLeay.xs comments from #if 0 to #define REM. This will
	  hopefully make it easier to compile with some vendor compilers
	- Added version detection code for OpenSSL-0.9.1c and checked
	  build
1.04  31.1.1999, Sampo Kellomaki <sampo@@_iki._fi>
	- Backward incompatible changes in OpenSSL API mean that 1.04 will
	  drop support for SSLeay and all OpenSSL versions prior
	  to 0.9.2b release. Thanks guys!
	- Detected errors in OpenSSL-0.9.2b/ssl/ssl.h - see patch in README
	- Reordered arguments of several functions to track OpenSSL-0.9.2b
	  changes. This also changes the order of args in corresponding
	  perl functions. You have been warned!
		- SSL_use_certificate_ASN1(s,d,len)  // swapped d and len
	- WARNING: Possibly fatal verify_callback parameter list issue
	  is still standing
	- cleaned up many macros that used to access ctx->session directly,
	  OpenSSL-0.9.2b defines thes macros properly so I use them now.
	- Added SSL_ctrl() and SSL_CTX_ctrl()
	- Added SSL_get_options(), SSL_CTX_get_options(),
	  SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list()
	- Removed SSL_add_session(), SSL_remove_session(),
          and SSL_flush_sessions() per #if 0 in ssl.h, line 667
	- Updated paths in various utility programs
	- Upgraded version number detection logic in Makefile.PL
	- Added -rsaref flag to Makefile.PL. This allows linking against rsaref
	30.7.1999, final squeeze to get this out --Sampo
	- upgrade to OpenSSL-0.9.3a
	- upper case all header names so keys of the hash returned
	  from get_https are predictible
	- fixed get_https and post_https so they don't do shutdown
	  anymore. This used to cause headaches when connection
	  renegotiation happened.
	- applied ssl_read_CRLF patch by Clinton Wong <clintdw@@netcom._com>
	- ActivePerl diffs from anton@@_genua.de applied,
	  but not tested.
1.05  31.1.1999, --Sampo
	- fixed test cert creation (lack of symlinks, reported
          by schinder@@_pobox.com)
	- callbacks fixed and tested to work
	- added Authentication examples
	- added couple more X509_STORE_CTX family functions
1.06  7.4.2001, --Sampo
	- fixed ssl_read_all bug where `0' input was mistaken for EOF.
	- openssl-0.9.6a fixes (e.g. random number generator init)
	- various minor fixes subnitted by fellow netters (sorry, I lost track
	  of your names so I do not name the contributors here)

	  then for some reason, my bad)
	- Added ability to set client certificate for https_cat and sslcat
	  as suggested by Avi Ben-Harush <avib@@_atomica.com>
