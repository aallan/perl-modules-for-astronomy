v0.92
	- Changed the fileno() function to support returning the fileno
	  of server sockets.  (Problem found by Roland Giersig
	  <RGiersig@cpan.org>).
	- Fixed SSL_version incorrectly defaulting to SSLv2 (patch from
	  Roland Alder <roland.alder@celeris.ch>).



--- Old Versions --------------------------------------------------

v0.91   2002.08.31
	- Added support for SSL_peek and SSL_pending (peek() and
	  pending()).  Updated documentation, tests, etc. to reflect
	  this.

v0.901  2002.08.19
	- Fixed the warning that happens when sockets are not explicitly
	  closed() before the program terminates.  


v0.90   2002.08.13
	- This version is a complete rewrite of IO::Socket::SSL.  It now 
	  has about half the lines of code, twice the amount of documentation, 
	  and a slightly more polished interface.
	- IO::Socket::SSL now works properly with mod_perl and taint mode.
	- Major documentation update.
	- Update of the BUGS file to reflect changes made in the rewrite.
	- Update of the test suite for Perl v5.8.0 (or, more precisely,
	  for Scalar::Util).
	- Update of the test suite for Perl v5.00503 (or, more precisely,
	  for the lack of several nice features added in v5.6.0) (Marko
	  Asplund <aspa@kronodoc.fi>).
	- New test suite that does not need the Internet to function.
	- Update of all the files in example/ to use more current features
	  of IO::Socket::SSL.
	- Removal of SSL_SSL and X509_Certificate classes.
	- There have been a few name changes (like socketToSSL ->
	  socket_to_SSL) for better consistency.
	- The functionality of get_peer_certificate() and friends is deprecated.
	- The functionality of want_write() and want_read() is deprecated.
	- The functionality of context_init() is deprecated for normal use.
	- Support for all SSL context options in the new() call.
	- SSL contexts are no longer global.  The SSL_reuse_ctx option
	  is provided for those who want to re-use a context.
	- The default verify mode is now VERIFY_NONE.
	- IO::Socket::SSL::DEBUG is now linked to Net::SSLeay::trace to
	  provide different levels of debugging information.
	- There is a uniform interface for error reporting, so on error
	  all functions will return undef and the error will be available
	  by calling errstr().
	- The dump_peer_certificate() and peer_certificate() functions
	  have been added.
	- sysread() will now behave correctly if the offset argument is
	  greater than the length of the read buffer.  It also will truncate
	  the read buffer properly, according to the Perl documentation for
	  sysread(), and account for $[.
	- getline(), getlines(), and getc() have been added.
	- syswrite() now uses references to avoid copying large amounts of data,
	  and will behave like Perl's syswrite even if you mess with $[ (but
	  don't do that).
	- readline() uses ssl_read_all in array context for improved speed.
	- close() now uses SSL_shutdown() to properly close an SSL connection,
	  unless you tell it not to.
	- If you have Net::SSLeay version 1.18 or greater, X509 certificates
	  will be properly freed.
	- All other known bugs have been fixed.


v0.81a (Not publically released)
	- Added support for SSL_passwd_cb.
	- Added accept() server socket support to socketToSSL().

v0.81   20020410
	- calling context_init twice destroyed global context. fix from
	  Jason Heiss <jheiss@ofb.net>.
	- file handle tying interface implementation moved to a separate
	  class to prevent problems resulting from self-tying filehandles.
	  Harmon S. Nine <hnine@netarx.com>.
	- docs/debugging.txt file added
	- require Net::SSLeay v1.08
	- preliminary support for non-blocking read/write
	- socketToSSL() now respects context's SSL verify setting
	  reported by Uri Guttman <uri@stemsystems.com>.

v0.80	20010819
	- fixed startTLS support (socketToSSL) (Graham Barr <gbarr@pobox.com>)
	- make accept() set fileno attribute on newly created IO::Socket::SSL
	  object (Martin Oldfield <m@mail.tc>).
	- certificate updates.
	- use SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file in SSL_Context::new.

v0.79	20010604
	- angle bracket readline operator support
	  (David Darville <david@dark.x.dtu.dk>).
	- eliminate warnings in choosing SSL protocol version.
	- implement our own opened method and make length parameter optional
	  in syswrite (Robert Bihlmeyer <robbe@orcus.priv.at>).

v0.78	20010424
	- test script targets changed, certificate setup fixed
	- support for TLS in SSL_version. SSL_version parameter values
	  changed from integer to string. NB: this is an incompatible change.
	  all SSL_version parameter values have to be changed. valid values
	  include: 'sslv2', 'sslv3', 'sslv23'. Stephen C. Koehler
	  <koehler@securecomputing.com>.
	- enable selecting SSL version for connections. patch from
	  Takanori Ugai <ugai@jp.fujitsu.com>.
	- allow setting SSL_ca_file to ''. this is needed for being
	  able to use SSL_ca_path (Robert Bihlmeyer <robbe@orcus.priv.at>).
	- include the Apache CA bundle file in the distribution (my-ca.pem).
	- BUGS file added.

v0.77	20010115
	- don't setup SSL CA verification unless cert verification is
	  actually used for the connections.
	- default SSL protocol version selection in SSL.pm.

v0.76	20001117
	- patch from Kwok Chern Yue <chernyue@post1.com> for
