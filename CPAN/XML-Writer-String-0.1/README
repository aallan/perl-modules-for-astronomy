XML/Writer/String version 0.1
=============================


This module implements a bare-bones class specifically for the purpose
of capturing data from the XML::Writer module. XML::Writer expects an
IO::Handle object and writes XML data to the specified object (or
STDOUT) via it's print() method. This module simulates such an object
for the specific purpose of providing the required print() method.

It is recommended that $writer->end() is called prior to calling
$s->value() to check for well-formedness.
