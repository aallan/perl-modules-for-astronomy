Self test suite for the libwww-perl library
-------------------------------------------

Tests are invoked by running the ./TEST script, but usually you run
the tests with "make test" at the top libwww-perl directory.  Use -v
option for verbose tests.  You might run an individual test like this:

  ./TEST -v base/date

or all tests in a directory like this

  ./TEST base

You enable network tests by creating the "net/config.pl" file.  A good
start is to make a copy of the "net/config.pl.dist" file.  For network
tests you should also make a link from the cgi-bin directory of your
http server to the "net/cgi-bin" directory.  You might also have to
check that the interpreter line (#!.../perl) in the scripts is ok for
your system.  The following setup works for my site:

  ln -s `pwd`/net/cgi-bin ~www/cgi-bin/lwp
  cp net/config.pl.dist net/config.pl
  emacs net/config.pl                        # fix if necessary
  ./TEST net
