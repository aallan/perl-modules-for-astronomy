PDL Module Dependencies

This file lists dependencies of PDL modules on external programs/libraries.
Some of the modules will build ok without the external software but in
general are not very useful without it. Others require certain
libraries/include files to be installed. See INSTALL on hints how to
enable/disable building of some modules in the distrib if required.

The easiest way to resolve dependencies on other Perl modules is to use
the CPAN module to install PDL. Installation should be as simple as

  cpan install PDL   # if the cpan script is in your path

or if you don't have the cpan script try

  perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> install PDL


MODULE          DEPENDS ON                  COMMENT

PDL (all)	perl 5.005		you need at least this version
					of perl to succeed.
		File::Spec		version >= 0.6 required, included
					with recent perls (5.6.x and higher)

PDL::Lvalue    	perl 5.6		not supported in pre 5.6

PDL::NiceSlice  Text::Balanced		a nicer way to index piddles
		Filter			a must-have!!

Inline::Pdlpp	Inline			version >= 0.43 required
					module allows to define fast PP code
					inline in your scripts

perldl (shell)  Term::ReadLine    	perl provides a stub but if you
					compile and install a better one
					(Term::ReadLine or
					Term::ReadLine::Gnu) you get proper
					command line editing

PDL::Graphics::TriD
		perl 5.6 &
                Requires OpenGL implementation. For free implementation
                check out Mesa at http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html

                                        Required. Module won't build
                                        without libraries. To disable
                                        edit perldl.conf (see INSTALL).

PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT
                PGPLOT perl module and PGPLOT fortran library,
                see http://astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot for the library
                and CPAN or http://www.aao.gov.au/local/www/kgb/pgperl
                for the perl module

                                        Module builds ok without
                                        PGPLOT module and library

PDL::Graphics::IIS
                To be useful an application that supports the
                'IIS' protocol must be installed, e.g. SAOimage
                or Ximtool, see
                http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/saoimage.html
                http://iraf.noao.edu/iraf/web/projects/x11iraf/x11iraf.html

                                        Builds without viewers.

PDL::Graphics::Karma
                Needs Karma visualisation library and tools.
                See http://www.atnf.csiro.au/karma. Binary distribs
                for many popular platforms available

                                        Module will only be built
                                        if library is installed on
                                        system.

PDL::IO::Pic
                rpic/wpic: pbm+ or netpbm converters
                 ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM
                 and ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg for jpeg converter

                wmpeg: mpeg_encode program,
                  see ftp://mm-ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/multimedia/mpeg/encode

                                        Module builds
                                        ok without converters

PDL::Slatec	ExtUtils::F77		linear algebra routines
					several other modules use PDL::Slatec
                Slatec fortran lib is included but requires a
		fortran compiler and the perl module ExtUtils::F77
		(version >= 1.03) to be installed.

                                        Will not be built unless
                                        ExtUtils::F77 (version >= 1.03)
					is installed and Extutils::F77
					supports your platform.
PDL::GSL modules
                Needs the GSL (Gnu Scientific Library) to build.
		Version >= 1.0 is required
		See http://sourceware.cygnus.com/gsl/

                                        Will not be built unless
					GSL is installed.
PDL::FFTW
                Needs the FFTW to build. (A free C FFT library
                including multi-dimensional, real, and parallel
                transforms) 
		See http://www.fftw.org/

                                        Will not be built unless
					FFTW is installed.

PDL::IO::Browser
		Requires a 'curses'-compatible library
		not built by default (edit perldl.conf to enable)

PDL::IO::NDF
                Requires the perl/NDF interface (NDFPERL).
                (which also requires a fortran compiler and the
                fortran NDF library). See either
                http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/jcmt_sw/perl/ or
                http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/cgi-store/storeform2?NDFPERL
                for information on NDFPERL. See
                http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/cgi-store/storeform2?NDF
                to retrieve the NDF libraries.

                                        Module builds ok without
                                        NDF module and library
