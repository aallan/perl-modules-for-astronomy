This is a port of the original PDL GSL Special Functions interface by
Christian Pellegrin <chri@infis.univ.trieste.it> to GSL 1.x. Only some
minor tweaks were necessary to get it going but documentation and
testing is in dire need of improvement!

We need: 

  - an example for every function (C<=for example> section in docs).

  - a test for every function (to go into t/gsl_sf.t)

Patches by GSL SF users are most welcome!
