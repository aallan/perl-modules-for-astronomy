INSTALLING on win32
-------------------

This is a collection of tips if you are trying to compile PDL
on win32. Your milage may vary. In general you might want to
fall back on the binary windows version provided at
http://pdl.perl.org .

Supported compilers: MS Visual Studio 6 has been reported to work

General procedure:

   perl Makefile.PL
   nmake

That should be it (in theory). Currently there are a number of niggles
but work arounds exist.

Compilation report
------------------

Version:  PDL 2.2.1 (actually CVS snapshot 19/6/01)

If you want to use slatec you need the f77 support and need the
F77CONF argument on the command line.

       perl Makefile.PL F77CONF=win32/win32f77.pl
       nmake

This will only work together with a working f2c and associated
libraries libi77.lib and libf77.lib.  You need to edit
win32/win32f77.pl to reflect the location of f2c, the libs and the
include file f2c.h. If you have problems just omit the F77CONF
argument from the 'perl Makefile.PL' command. In that case you won't
have slatec support though.

Niggle:

The first nmake stops with an error that Core.obj is not found.
Workaround: once you get this error do the following:

   cd Basic\Core
   nmake Core.xs
   cd ..\..
   perl Makefile.PL # with F77CONF=win32/win32f77.pl if you want slatec
   nmake

Now it should work.

Finish with

   nmake test

Should pass everything but test 6 in conv.t. Safe to ignore for now.

Making an installable PPM
-------------------------

Some pseudo code how to go about that
is in the file makeppm.pl (which is currently
really just comments).

UPDATE: A target 'ppm' is now available
from the makefile.

  make ppm

should do the job, however, it relies on
a number of programs like cp, mv, tar, etc.
