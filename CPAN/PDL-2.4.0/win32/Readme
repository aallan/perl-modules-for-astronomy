This is a ppm of PDL-2.2.1+ (snapshot of 19/06/01) to work with
activestate builds of perl 5.6. 

News: This build has slatec support! (compiled using f2c)

Version of PDL: PDL-2.2.1snap061901

built and packaged by: Christian Soeller <c.soeller@auckland.ac.nz>

Installation:

  unzip the zip archive (using folder names)
  use the package manager to install PDL:

    ppm install --location=. PDL

PDL HTML Docs are installed into the activestate html tree. However,
due to a shortcoming of the current version of ppm, they are *not*
reflected in the activestate index of perl documentation. Please
point your browser by hand to the files in the html/lib/PDL directory.
The crossrefs in the html files are currently broken. The postinstall
script needs to fix this in the future.

PBMplus converters for gif, jpeg and postscript formats are
included (see PDL::IO::Pic).

Not yet supported on win32 are:

   Graphics (PGPLOT is separate; see comments at
             http://pdl.perl.org/download)
   Memory mapped data access
   TriD OpenGL backend (VRML should be ok but requires Win32::DDE)
