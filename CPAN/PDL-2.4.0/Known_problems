The following issues have been reported with this version of
PDL. 

- Some bus errors have been reported with PDL and perl 5.005
  built with the threading option.

- SGI format failure on some machines in t/picnorgb.t and t/picrgb.t
(Jarle Brinchmann reported this on 11/3/98).

- The html docs for the modules in IO/Misc aren't being built during 'make
  install' (this one seems to be fixed now). 

- Some problems have been reported with PDL and perl5.005/5.6.0 (core dumps, 
   and/or regression tests failing) when perl is compiled with the perl-
   provided malloc. This has been reported on the following platforms:
     * R5000 Indy machine running Irix 6.2
     * Sun Solaris 2.5, gcc.
     * HPUX
     * Sun Solaris 2.6, gcc, perl5.6.0 (ActivePerl)

- If @INC has '.' at the front of the search path part of the build will
  fail (specifically mkpdlconv will not be able to 'use English' since
  it uses Exporter.pm from Basic/Core and not the system Exporter.pm).
