pdl (1:2.3.1-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream release

pdl (1:2.2.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Introduced a build-depends on libextutils-f77-perl.  [Which
    breaks cross compilation since I've not released that package yet --
    waiting on DFSG copyright, but allows building with slatec.]

 -- Raul Miller <moth@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Jun 2001 22:54:30 -0400

pdl (1:2.2.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * fix postinst.base -- postinst was missing set -e

 -- Raul Miller <moth@debian.org>  Fri, 25 May 2001 11:09:44 -0400

pdl (1:2.2.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ok, found out how to resolve $Config{version}.

 -- Raul Miller <moth@debian.org>  Fri, 25 May 2001 01:04:12 -0400

pdl (1:2.2.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * changed INSTALLDIRS=perl to INSTALLDIRS=vendor in debian/rules,
    for the new perl policy, changed Build-Depends to match.
    (fixes #95423)
  * made other changes to debian/rules and debian/control as indicated
    by this new policy.  I hope the OPTIMIZE attribute doesn't hose PDL...
  * FIXME: I've backed out compliance with 3.4.2 of the new perl policy:
    "Binary modules must specify a dependency on either perl or
     perl-base with a minimum version of the perl package used to
     build the module, and must additionally depend on the expansion of
     perlapi-$Config{version}." 
    This fails to indicate what context to use for that expansion. In
    my initial tests, this broke the package, and `apt-cache search
    perlapi` turns up nothing.

pdl (1:2.2.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * replaced mesag-dev with xlibmesa-dev in build depends.  (fixes #97508)
    replaced mesag3 with libgl1 in depends.
  * Rant: [None of this rant is immediately relevant to this version
    of PDL, except through examining the implications of bug #97508.]
    This whole "trash the old i/o-library interface" thing strikes
    me as *really bad*.  Interfaces should be treated as sacred,
    and maintaining backwards compatibility is important for long term
    system survivability.  Basically, what we're saying here is that
    these interfaces are immature, and people who built code against
    the earlier (obsolete) libraries acted prematurely.  Either that,
    or we're saying that distributing binary packages for debian is
    a mistake on the part of anyone outside of debian.  
  * I'm leaving the Build-Depends for libncurses-dev in the control file,
    even though it's now a virutal package, to see if I get any bug
    reports filed against pdl because of it (for the record, I'm using
    version 5.2.20010318-1 of libncurses5-dev to build this instance).
  * updated debian/rules (added prerm, minor cleanups)

 -- Raul Miller <moth@debian.org>  Mon, 21 May 2001 10:18:55 -0400

pdl (1:2.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * renamed directory from PDL-2.2.1 to pdl-2.2.1, and chmod +x debian/rules
    (required so that dpkg-buildpackage works).  
  * changed Source-Depends: to Build-Depends: in control file, and restored
    build dependency for libncurses-dev.
  * restored debian/postinst.base and debian/prerm from debian 2.2

 -- Raul Miller <moth@debian.org>  Sun, 20 May 2001 22:14:49 -0400

pdl (1:2.2.1-0) unstable; urgency=low

pdl (1:2.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * delete bogus debian.orig directory

 -- Raul Miller <moth@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Mar 2001 15:15:59 -0500

pdl (1:2.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * new upstream release
  * turned off make test because it has problems:
      1. requires an active X session (bad for autobuilders), and
      2. requires slatec (or linfit fails).  [Can't support
         slatec until ExtUtils::F77 is a debian package]
  * bumped up urgency because old pdl doesn't support newest
    perl, and some people consider that serious.

 -- Raul Miller <moth@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Mar 2001 20:51:12 -0500

pdl (1:2.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * reintroduced scantree.pl and mkhtmldoc to postinst (fixes
    problem reported in private email by Dav Clark and Gordon Haverland
    -- thanks).
  * note: this version won't purge cleanly, as it creates a couple
    files a postinst time which aren't removed even at purge time.
  * got rid of bashisms from debian/rules
  * translated /usr/doc to /usr/share/doc and /usr/man to /usr/share/man
  * never released -- ignore epoch

 -- Raul Miller <moth@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Nov 2000 01:17:43 -0500

pdl (2.1.1-0pre1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream version
  * this is a pre-release, among other things, I'm waiting for xlib6g-dev
    to stabilize.  Please email me, personally, with any bug reports.
    This is not an official release.  Changes from the 2.1.1 sources on
    sourceforge for this prerelease:
      + chmod +x debian/rules
      + this entry in debian/changelog
      + editted copy of perldl.conf as debian/.perldl.conf (no -lMesa*)
      + HOME=`pwd`/debian added to Makefile.PL part of debian/rules

pdl (2.005-2) frozen; urgency=medium

  * Argh, forgot to fix t/gauss.t -- this is required
    for Bug#55268 to really be fixed.

 -- Raul Miller <moth@debian.org>  Tue, 25 Apr 2000 13:45:28 -0400

pdl (2.005-1) frozen; urgency=medium

  * new bugfix upstream version
  * two hacks:  (1) disable #ifdef in Basic/Math/mconf.h which includes 
    <nan.h> on our linux alpha, (2) disable test which shows that guassian 
    doesn't work properly on our linux alpha.  (Fixes Bug#55268)

pdl (2.003-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream version

 -- Raul Miller <moth@debian.org>  Mon,  1 Nov 1999 07:16:55 -0500

pdl (2.002-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * new maintainer
  * recreated source package, unpack in pdl-2.002 instead of PDL-2.002
    [this oddity in source package accounts for earlier diff problems].  
    (Fixes #45771).
  * do "make test" at build time
  * removed suggests jpeg-progs, I can't find any such package
  * removed suggests pgperl, there's a well labeled demo that fails
    and that should be enough of a suggestion for people who would want
    this non-free support.  If there's demand, and if special compilation
    support turns out to be needed, I supposed I'll have to create
    a pdl-nonfree...

 -- Raul Miller <moth@debian.org>  Sun, 10 Oct 1999 19:20:09 -0400

pdl (2.002-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixes #36402, docs are now made at build time and are purged
    with dpkg --purge. Also previous cruft from old versions is purged 
    in preinst.
  * Fixes #38429, typo in Depends
