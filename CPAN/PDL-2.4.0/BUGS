BUG REPORTS
-----------

If you make a bug report please always include the full
output of

  perldl -V

Submit your bug report to the bug database 

   http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=612

Be sure to include a way we can contact you for
further information (especially if you posted your
bug anonymously!).

Alternatively, send a report (again including the output
of 'perldl -V') to pdl-porters@jach.hawaii.edu . See

   http://pdl.perl.org/maillists

for info on how to subscribe to this list if necessary.

BEFORE YOU SEND A REPORT
------------------------

BEFORE you report a bug make sure you got the latest
release version of PDL (always available from CPAN,
check http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=PDL). Also
check the FAQ (http://pdl/sourceforge.net/FAQ) and
the mailing list archives for hints. You can find
links to the searchable archives at

   http://pdl.perl.org/maillists

PATCHES
-------

Patches can be send to the pdl-porters mailing list
(see above) or can be directly submitted to the
patch manager

   http://sourceforge.net/patch/?group_id=612

Patches should be made against the latest released
PDL or, ideally, against the current CVS sources
which you can browse and check out at

  http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=612
