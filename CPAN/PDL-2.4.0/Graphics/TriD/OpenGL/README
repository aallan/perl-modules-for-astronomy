This is a rewrite of the OpenGL 0.5 module.  It now requires and
is distributed with the module PDL.  The script opengl.pd reads 
the GL header files as defined in perldl.conf and builds an interface
for GL.  It has thus far been tested on the following GL:

  GL_VERSION:  1.1 Irix 6.5
  GL_VENDOR:   SGI
  GL_RENDERER: IMPACT/1/1/1

  GL_VERSION:  1.2 Mesa 3.3 beta
  GL_VENDOR:   Brian Paul
  GL_RENDERER: Mesa X11

If you successful build it on another platform please let me know so
that I can add it to this list.  If you cannot successfully build it,
try to pinpoint the problem as much as possible and I can try to help
as time permits.  The GL include files are run through cpp before
prototypes are read from them, often the problem is just finding the
right OPENGL_DEFINE flags to put in the perldl.conf.  If you change
perldl.conf you must rerun perl Makefile.PL at the top level.
