#

SOAP-MIME-0.55-7 (16-April-2003)
* Relaxed parsing of the start parameter located inside the
  Content-type header.
* Fixed bug around an overlooked unqualified package name.
* Added CHANGE_LOG and INSTALL files to distro.

SOAP-MIME-0.55-6 (18-March-2003)
* Added support for server side attachment support. Where 
  before only client side parsing was supported, this release

  element in their responses. SOAP::MIME will automagically 
  serialize those parts into a properly mime formatted message.

* Reworked the parsing of the response to return an array
  of MIME::Entity objects which enables to user to more fully
  utilize the functionality contained within that module

SOAP-MIME-0.55-4 (15-July-2002)
* Ability to process attachments on the server side has not 
  yet been tested.

SOAP-MIME-0.55-3 (?)
* Documentation updates.

SOAP-MIME-0.55-2 (?)
* Small bug fixes.

SOAP-MIME-0.55-1 (12-June-2002)
* Need to add ability to compose and send attachments.
