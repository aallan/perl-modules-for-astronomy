OVERVIEW

This Version: 0.55-6

SOAP::Lite (http://www.soaplite.com/) is a SOAP Toolkit
that allows users to create SOAP clients and services. As
of June 12, 2002, MIME support in SOAP::Lite was minimal.
It could parse MIME formatted messages, but the data 
contained in those attachments was "lost." This Perl module,
patches SOAP::Lite so that those MIME attachments are
stored and placed into a SOAP::SOM object.

PREREQUISITES

You must first install SOAP::Lite prior to installing SOAP::MIME, as
SOAP::MIME is a patch to SOAP::Lite. SOAP::Lite version 0.55 required.

You can install SOAP::Lite easily, by downloading the module from 
http://soaplite.com/ or as you would install any perl module library,
by running these commands:

If you have CPAN.pm installed and are connected to the Internet:

   perl -MCPAN -e shell
   > install SOAP::Lite

or even 

   perl -MCPAN -e 'install SOAP::Lite'

INSTALLATION

Install SOAP::MIME just as you would any other Perl module:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Use nmake instead of make on Windows platform.

DOCUMENTATION

See lib/SOAP/Lite.pm for an overview of the library. Documentation is 
included in modules and scripts. These are normally converted to manual 
pages and installed as part of the "make install" process.  You should 
also be able to use the 'perldoc' utility to extract and read 
documentation from the module files directly.

LIMITATIONS

- This implementation patches SOAP::Lite. But 'use'ing it, you completely
  override functions found in SOAP::Lite. This may produce weird behavior
  if you are not using attachments. What 'wierd' means, I don't know. But
  if you find something, please file a bug in sourceforge:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/soapmime

SUPPORT

Feel free to send mail directly to author with your comments, suggestions, 
bug reports and complaints.
