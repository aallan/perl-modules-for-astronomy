SOAP::MIME follows the conventions of any CPAN Perl Module. The simplest way
to install SOAP::MIME manually is the typical:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

** Naturally, you would use nmake instead of make on Windows platform.

Of course, CPAN shell is yet another way to install the module, and arguably
easier considering that it automatically resolves any dependencies for you:

   perl -MCPAN -e shell
   > install SOAP::Lite

or even 

   perl -MCPAN -e 'install SOAP::Lite'
