XML::NamespaceSupport


    This module offers a simple way to process namespaced XML names
    (unames) from within any application that may need them. It
    also helps maintain a prefix to namespace URI map, and provides
    a number of basic checks.

    The model for this module is SAX2's NamespaceSupport class,
    readable at

    http://www.megginson.com/SAX/Java/javadoc/org/xml/sax/helpers/NamespaceSupport.html.

    It adds a few perlisations where we thought it appropriate.
