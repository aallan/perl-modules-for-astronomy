DESCRIPTION

  XML::Simple - Easy API to read/write XML (esp config files)


PREREQUISITES

  XML::Simple requires a module capable of parsing XML - either XML::SAX or
  XML::Parser must be installed (if you're running ActivePerl, you'll
  already have XML::Parser installed).

  If you have installed XML::SAX, it will be used by default.  You should
  consider installing XML::SAX::Expat or XML::LibXML to replace the (slower)
  PurePerl parser from the XML::SAX distribution.

  If you install using the CPAN.pm shell and you do not have either XML::Parser
  or XML::SAX installed, then XML::SAX will be installed by default.

  To generate documents with namespaces, XML::NamespaceSupport is required.

  The optional caching features of XML::Simple also require Storable.pm.


WARNING MESSAGES FROM XML::SAX

  When you use XML::Simple, you may see this warning message:

    could not find ParserDetails.ini in C:/Perl/site/lib/XML/SAX

  This means your XML::SAX installation is broken (perhaps you installed
  version 0.10 from the ActiveState PPM repository).  Since it's broken 
  anyway, the simplest way to suppress these warnings is to remove
  C:/Perl/site/lib/XML/SAX.pm.

  The procedure for correctly installing the latest version of XML::SAX
  is documented here:

    http://perl-xml.sourceforge.net/faq/#win32_cpan

BUILDING/INSTALLING

  Once the archive is unpacked, use these commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

  If for some reason, you can't run these commands, you can simple copy 
  the Simple.pm file to your lib/XML directory (where Parser.pm lives).

  If you want to test the module, but don't have 'make', try:

      perl maketest
