Tk::Pgplot
==========

**Beta version**

Pgplot widget for Perl/Tk. This module is the perl front end to a port
of the pgplot Tcl/Tk driver to Perl/Tk. It uses the same basic X code
used by the Tcl/Tk and Motif drivers supplied with pgplot, and a
modified version of the Tcl/Tk code. Due to this dependency of X code,
it is unlikely to run on any OS that does not support X (ie Windows). 

Requirements:
-------------

- An ansi C compiler
- Standard X libraries
- A *modified* version of pgplot 5.2.2
- A Fortran 77 compiler (for pgplot)

Platforms:
----------
 This has been tested with

   - Linux
	Redhat 7.0	gcc 2.96 perl-5.6.0 Tk800.022
	SuSE   7.3	gcc 2.95 perl-5.6.1 Tk800.023

   - Solaris	
	5.6		egcs-2.91.66 perl-5.005_02 Tk800.022

   - HP-UX   - Last tested with Tk-Pgplot 0.2
	10.20		gcc perl-5.005_02 Tk800.022

Installation:
-------------

 - You *must* supply a patch to pgplot to include the perl/tk driver
   (see PGPLOT.patch).

 - Edit Makefile.PL and change the location of the pgplot libraries if need be.
   By default it assumes the pgplot libraries and includes are pointed to 
   by the environment variable PGPLOT_DIR. 

  > perl Makefile.PL
  > make
  > make test
  > make install

Dependencies:
-------------
 
 - The Caltech pgplot library
 - The Perl PGPLOT Module (available from CPAN)
 - The ExtUtils::F77 Module from CPAN (also needed by the Pgplot module)

Documentation:
--------------

Please see the driver documentation for options from the Tcl/Tk
version. However there is one difference in usage. The Tcl version
uses the Tcl name of the widget to identify the widget to pgopen. This
does not map well to perl, so an extra configure option has been
added, "name". The name given to the widget must be supplied to
pgopen(). E.g.

  use Tk;
  use Tk::Pgplot;
  use PGPLOT;
  my $mw = MainWindow->new;
  my $f = $mw->Frame();
  my $pgplot = $f->Pgplot(-name => 'mypgplot');
  pgopen('mypgplot/ptk');

The supported options should work identically. See the included test
scripts for an example of usage.

Bugs:
-----

- You cannot create a Pglot widget directly in the MainWindow. It needs to
  be created within a Frame.
- make test fails (for me) on HP-UX. However perl test.pl works fine.
- the scroll bars don't work on the test program (but they do on the demo)
- On Solaris, I cannot work out how to autodetect if perl is present. As 
  you wouldn't be installing this without perl I guess it is not very
  important
