Astro::SLA -- interface to C or Fortran SLALIB library
==========

This module provides an interface layer to the C or Fortran version of
the SLALIB library.  From the abstract of the SLALIB manual (written
by Pat Wallace):

   "SLALIB is a library used by writers of positional-astronomy
   applications. Most of the 171 routines are concerned with
   astronomical position and time, but a number have wider
   trigonometrical, numerical or general applications."

An example program, stime, is provided. This simply reports the
current time (modified Julian day and local sidereal time for the JCMT).

Requirements:
-------------

This module requires either the C or Fortran version of the SLALIB
library written by Pat Wallace. 

This module has been tested with the Starlink Fortran library v2.4-8
(released September 2001) and the April 2002 release of the C
library. If you are working with orbital elements you need a version
of the library released sometime in 2002.

You must have either the C version of the library or the Starlink
Fortran version of the library in order to build this module.

The Fortran version of SLALIB is available from Starlink under the
Starlink Software Licence (effectively meaning free for non-commercial
use). You can download it from Starlink (http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk)
using the Starlink Software Store
(http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/Software/software_store.htm).
Specifically: http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/cgi-store/storeform1?SLA

Please contact Pat Wallace (ptw@tpsoft.demon.co.uk) for details of how
to obtain the (proprietary) C SLALIB library.

A C compiler is required - this is an XS module. A Fortran compiler (such
as g77) is required if you are building against the Fortran library [or
at least the Fortran runtime libraries].

Platforms:
----------

   This module has been tested on the following platforms:

   - Sparc Solaris 8, Sun Compiler 6, perl 5.005_03
   - Sparc Solaris 8, Sun Compiler 6, perl 5.6.1
   - RedHat Linux 7.3, gcc2.96, perl5.8.0
   - RedHat Linux 7.3, gcc2.96, perl5.6.1


Installation:
-------------

 - Edit the Makefile.PL so that the location of the SLA
   library and include files are correct. [see variables $sla_lib and
   $sla_inc]. By default the module attempts to find the Starlink
   installation and then falls back to assuming the C version is 
   installed. Change the value of $use_fortran if you know you are
   using an explicit C or Fortran version.
 
   It is assumed the C library is available from /usr/local/lib by default.

   The includes files, slalib.h, should be available
   in the default path. If they are somewhere else the Makefile.PL 
   should be edited to reflect this location. For example,
   change the line
 
     my $sla_inc => '',

   to

     my $sla_inc => '-I/home/me/include',

   to pick them up from /home/me/include

Then:

  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

The tests only test part of the build. Some functions remain untested.
In particular orbital element support will not be very good unless you
have a modern installation of SLALIB (sometime from 2002). Astro::Coords
will require a new module.

Documentation:
--------------

The module provides documentation on how to use the perl interface
to SLALIB. It does not contain information on how to use
SLALIB itself. For more information on SLALIB see:
