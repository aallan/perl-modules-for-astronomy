XML::Writer is a simple Perl module for writing XML documents: it
takes care of constructing markup and escaping data correctly, and by
default, it also performs a significant amount of well-formedness
checking on the output, to make certain (for example) that start and
end tags match, that there is exactly one document element, and that
there are not duplicate attribute names.

Here is an example:

  my $writer = new XML::Writer();

  $writer->startTag('greeting', 'type' => 'simple');
  $writer->characters("Hello, world!");
  $writer->endTag('greeting');
  $writer->end();

If necessary, error-checking can be turned off for production use.

Versions 0.2 and forward also contains extensive Namespace support and
some basic methods for querying the current element context.  See the
Changes file for more information about differences from version 0.1,
and the embedded POD documentation for information on using
XML::Writer.

Version 0.3 includes some bug fixes and supports an explicit
'encoding' parameter for the XML declaration.
