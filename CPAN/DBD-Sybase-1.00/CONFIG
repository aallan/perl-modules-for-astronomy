# Configuration file for DBD::Sybase.

# The Makefile.PL file attempts to set reasonable defaults for the
# variables in this file.
#
# Where is the Sybase directory on your system (include files &
# libraries are expected to be found at SYBASE/include & SYBASE/lib
# If not set, uses the SYBASE environment variable.
SYBASE=$ENV{SYBASE}||'/opt/sybase'

# Additional libraries.
# Some systems require -lnsl or -lBSD.
# Solaris 2.x needs -ltli
# SGI IRIX needs -linsck (and may need need -ltli)
# DEC OSF/1 needs -ldnet_stub and may need -lsdna and -linsck or -ltli
# SunOS 4.x needs -linsck
# HP-UX 10.x needs -linsck
# AIX 3.2.5 needs -linsck
# Linux needs -linsck
# See the Sybase OpenClient Supplement for your OS/Hardware
# combination.
# If not set, will attempt to determine which libraries are needed by scanning the
# $SYBASE/lib directory.

# DBI_INCLUDE
# DBD::Sybase needs access to some C include files that are provided
# by the DBI module. These are normally found in $Config{sitearchexp}/auto/DBI
# but if they are in some other place on your system then you can specify
# that directory here:
# DBI_INCLUDE=/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/sun4-solaris/

# BUILD_TYPE
# Set this to 64 if you are building in 64 bit mode on a platform
# that supports the 64bit OpenClient libraries (libct64.a, etc).
# BUILD_TYPE=64


# LINKTYPE
# If you wish to link DBD::Sybase statically
# into perl uncomment the line below and run the make normally. Then,
# when you run 'make test' a new perl binary will be built.
#LINKTYPE=static
