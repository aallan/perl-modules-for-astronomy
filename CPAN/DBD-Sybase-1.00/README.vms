Subject: DBD::Sybase 0.15 makefile.pl patch for VMS
Date: Tue, 18 May 1999 17:39:59 -0500

Two minor fixes to makefile.pl were necessary.  The first one avoids a
double colon in the filename for MAN3PODS.  The second moves the call
to unixify up earlier where it needs to be.  The patch at the end of
this message accomplishes both.  I did my build using DEC C V5.2-003
on OpenVMS Alpha V7.1 with perl 5.005_03, DBI 1.08.

<NOTE from mpeppler: the patch has been applied to the Makefile.PL>

There is a bug in the VMS portion of Liblist.pm that messes up the
order of the libraries when creating the linker options file.  You can
either edit sybase.opt by hand to restore the original order or apply
the patch available at the following location:

for 5.005_02:

for 5.005_03:
<http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/vmsperl/1999-05/msg00057.html>

and a fix for File::Spec:VMS is necessary to get the test suite to even
begin to work:

Oh, and if you want Dynaloader to find it (pretty important), rename
sybase.exe to libsybase.exe after you do the install.
