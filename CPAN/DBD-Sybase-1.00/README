This Sybase DBI driver is built using the Sybase OpenClient Client
Library (aka CT-library). You will need to have that installed before
you can do anything with this package. You will also need Tim Bunce's
DBI module, latest release. DBI is available from CPAN, in

    "CPAN"/authors/id/TIMB/DBI-1.xx-tar.gz

The Sybase OpenClient libraries are of course available from Sybase.
For Linux you can get the full Sybase ASE 11.0.3.3 release for free
(this includes the server and the client libraries.)
See http://linux.sybase.com for details, or my homepage 
(http://www.mbay.net/~mpeppler).

An alternative is to use the FreeTDS reimplementation of Client Library.
With FreeTDS DBD::Sybase can be used to query a MS-SQL 7 or 2000
database server from a Unix/linux host.
See http://www.freetds.org for details.

If you use FreeTDS please read the README.freetds file.

DBD::Sybase is a reasonably complete implementation of the DBI spec, but 
there are still some features that are missing. Please see the DBD::Sybase
man page for details.

The full write-ups of the bugs that are listed below as "fixed" can be
seen at http://www.peppler.org/cgi-bin/bug.cgi.

Getting Help
============

If you are stuck please start by searching the Web, the appropriate
mailing lists and my bug database, as it is likely that someone else
will have experienced the same problem before you.

The sybperl-l mailing list is dedicated to Sybase <-> perl issues and 
covers both the sybperl modules (Sybase::CTlib, etc.) and DBD::Sybase.
It is archived and searchable at http://www.peppler.org/archive/sybperl-l/

If after seaching you still don't find any solution then post a question
(with as much detail as possible) to either dbi-users@perl.org,
sybperl-l@peppler.org or freetds@lists.ibiblio.org (only use the
latter if you use the FreeTDS libraries with DBD::Sybase).


Recent changes:

Release 1.00

	Removed "beta" tag!
	Added data_sources().
        Allow "SQL_BINARY" placeholder parameters to be passed either
        as a hex string (with or without leading 0x), or as raw binary
        data.

	Bugs Fixed:

	477 - segfault when servermsg_cb is called with a null connection
	480 - Makefile.PL searches system dirs before PERL5LIB dirs when 
              looking for DBI installation.
	485 - Incorrect handling of large varbinary columns on fetches.
	489 - (same as 497, see below).
	492 - Can't compile on Win2k.
	494 - Do not try to use the ocs.cfg file if it exists.
	495 - Incorrect handling of parameters when using placeholders &
              stored procs.
        497 - implicit type conversions with prepared statements often fail
	503 - Binary placeholders with stored procedures.
	506 - Default scriptName/hostname connect() params.
	508 - DBD::Sybase doesn't build under Win2k.

Release 0.95

        Support for building DBD::Sybase in 64 bit mode with the
        64 bit version of OpenClient on Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, etc.
        (note that perl itself must also be built in 64 bit
        mode for this to work!)

	Added column_info() method.

	Added G_EVAL flag to syb_err_handler calls.
	Improved syb_err_handler handling (thanks to Matthew Persico)
        Fixed memory leak when opening additional connections for multiple
        statement handles on a single database handle (thanks to Stefan
        Harbeck)
        Applied minor patch by Alex Fridman to get to build on WinNT.
	Force a ct_cancel() if, due to syb_do_proc_status, we force a 
	failure on a request that could have more results pending (Blaise 
	Lepeuple)
	Added syb_cancel_request_on_error attribute (see bug 471).
	Warning - the default value for this attribute changes the behavior
	of $sth->execute() when there is a failure that is detected in
	multi-statement requests.
	Added syb_bind_empty_string_as_null attribute (see bug 446) to
	allow user configurable empty string binding semantics (convert
	to single space [default] or to NULL).

	Bugs Fixed:

	431 - fetchrow_hashref() has incorrect keys when retrieving
              multiple result sets.
        437 - imp_sth->numRows in st_next_result not always set.
	444 - Incorrect example for ct_get_data(). ct_get_data() SEGV
              if passed a non-reference for $image.
        394 - $sth->{CursorName} fails hard.
	449 - ct_get_data() limited to 32k
	450 - Fix incorrect NULLABLE handling.
	452 - Incorrect $sth->finish() handling in syb_flush_finish mode
              (thanks to Steve Willer).
        443 - $sth->fetch produces error if called after $sth->execute on
	      statement that doesn't return any rows.
	411 - statement handle attributes do not change between result sets.
	430 - $dbh->prepare can return undef without triggering RaiseError.
	436 - Problems with make test generating errors creating 
              Makefile.aperl.
	441 - amadmin who,sqm fails while in a transaction.
	446 - Empty string converts to a space (fixed by making this
	      configurable).
	448 - define strncasecmp as strnicmp for Win32 systems.
	454 - syb_err_handler won't catch connect-time error.
	456 - ping still fails if connection is dead.
	461 - Memory leak if NOT using placeholders in selects and
	      calling execute() multiple times.
	464 - Binding an empty string for a date field causes "1/1/1900"
              to be inserted (instead of NULL).
	469 - nsql error handling bug.
	447 - syb_db_disconnect(): ct_con_drop() failed.
	471 - Certain class of errors isn't detected by DBD::Sybase.


        Documentation changes to explain why 
         ... WHERE (product_code = ? OR (? IS NULL AND product_code IS NULL))
        doesn't work with Sybase.
	


Release 0.94

        Added optional SQL buffer argument to syb_err_handler.
	Interactive setting of user/server/pwd entries in PWD
	for "make test".
	Add syb_failed_db_fatal and syb_no_child_con attributes.

	Bugs Fixed:

	408 - Add the YYYYMMDD format to _date_fmt().
	414 - Binding '' is interpreted as NULL.
	415 - Fix buffer overlow in syb_db_login().
	418 - Fix incorrect handing of CS_CANCELED return code in 
              st_next_result().
        421 - ActiveState patches.



Building:

This version attempts to find out which libraries it needs by looking
at $SYBASE/lib ($SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS/lib for ASE 12.x installations.) 
This behaviour is experimental, and will only work
on Unix and VMS systems (ie on Win32 you still have to edit the CONFIG
file the old way), but appears to work fine on the two systems I have
access to (Sybase 12.0/Solaris 7 & Sybase 12.5/linux) and on Sybase
10.0.2.3/OpenVMS AXP 7.1. It assumes that $SYBASE is set and points to 
the Sybase installation directory that you want to use to build 
DBD::Sybase, and will also use the value of $SYBASE_OCS if it is set.

Start by editing the PWD file to set a valid user, password and server
for the test scripts to use.
Make sure that the SYBASE environment variable points to the Sybase
installation that you want to use for this build.

Then run 
	perl Makefile.PL
If there were warnings about missing libraries, go to the manual 
configuration, below.
Run
	make
If the make failed, go to the manual configuration, below.
Run
	make test
If this succeeds you can install the package, via
	make install
(which you probably have to run as root.)

Manual Configuration:

If the automatic configuration fails, then you will have to edit the
CONFIG file, and set the EXTRA_LIBS entry according to your OS and
Sybase release, and then run 
	perl Makefile.PL --file

The CONFIG file can be used to set certain system variables that
are needed for the build. 
	SYBASE is the root directory of your Sybase installation. DBD::Sybase
	will use $SYBASE/lib and $SYBASE/include during the build.

	EXTRA_LIBS lists any extra libraries that are required on your
	system. For example, Solaris 2.x needs -ltli. See your OS specific
	documentation supplement from Sybase to determine what is required.

	DBI_INCLUDE is the directory where DBI installed its include files.
	Makefile.PL will normally deduce this directory from perl's Config
	module, so you only need to set this if Makefile.PL fails.

	LINKTYPE. Uncomment and set to 'static' if you want to build
	DBD::Sybase statically (ie always included in a new perl binary).

Edit PWD, and set the user, password and server that you want to use for the 
'make test'.

Run perl Makefile.PL, make, make test.

If everything's fine, run "make install" to move the files to your 
installed perl library tree.


Known Problems:
===============

Solaris 2.x:
-----------
On Solaris 2.x make test will fail if LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set and has
/usr/lib or /lib before $SYBASE/lib. This is because both Solaris 2.x
and Sybase have a library called libintl.so, and if /usr/lib is placed 
before $SYBASE/lib in LD_LIBRARY_PATH the dynamic loader will search
the wrong library when loading DBD::Sybase. In general it is not
necessary to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Solaris, and it is only rarely
necessary to include /usr/lib or /lib in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH as those
directories will be searched by default.

Linux:
------
If the LANG or LC_ALL environment variable is set and points to an 
entry that does not exist in $SYBASE/locales/locales.dat (in the 
[linux] section) then you will get a core dump. This is an
OpenClient problem. 
See http://www.mbay.net/~mpeppler/Linux-ASE-FAQ.html#q1.14 for
additional details.

FreeTDS:
--------

See the README.freetds file for details.

The regression tests cover the normal operations, but they are by no 
means complete, so don't necessarily believe all is fine if the
tests succeed...

NOTE: t/fail.t will *fail* on test #8 if you are connecting to 
      an 11.0.3.3 server. This is a bug in the server, and not something
      that I can do anything about, unfortunately. It's a fairly
      obscure constraint violation condition - read the code if
      you are interested.

I have a simple bug tracking database at http://www.peppler.org/cgi-bin/bug.cgi
You can use it to check for known problems, and to report new ones. Keep
in mind that peppler.org lives on the end of a K56 dialup line, so it
may be slow.

See perldoc DBD::Sybase for details about the package.

Comments, criticism, etc. welcome!
