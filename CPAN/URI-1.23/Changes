   Make test suite work for UNC paths.
   Patch by Warren Jones <wjones@fluke.com>.



2002-09-02   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   extra methods to manipulate the query form
   key/value pairs.

   Patch by Ville Skyttä <ville.skytta@iki.fi>.



2002-05-09   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.19

   URI::Heuristic will guess better on strings
   like "123.3.3.3:8080/foo".  It used to think that
   the numbers before ":" was a scheme.

   URI::WithBase will not keep the full history of
   any base URI's base URI etc.  This used to make
   these objects grow into to monsters for some
   web spiders.

   URI::URL->new("foo", "bar")->base used to return
   a "URI" object.  Now an URI::URL object is returned
   instead.

   Deal properly with file:///-URIs.



2001-12-30   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.18

   Added support for ssh: URIs.
   Contributed by Jean-Philippe Bouchard <jeanphil@sitepak.com>

   the anonymous password.
   Patch by Eduardo Pérez <eperez@dei.inf.uc3m.es>.



2001-09-14   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.17

   Fixed unescape of %30 in $http_uri->canonical.

   Fixed test failure for t/heuristic.t on cygwin.

   Fixed warning noise from t/old-base.t on bleadperl.
   Perl now warns for pack("c*", $i) when $i > 127.



2001-08-27   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.16

   URI::Escape::uri_escape default has changed.  Reserved
   characters are now escaped when no second argument is
   provided.

   The perl5.004 backwards compatibility patching taking place
   in the Makefile.PL should now work for MacPerl.
   Patch by KIMURA Takeshi <kim@ga2.so-net.ne.jp>.

   URI::WithBase now overrides the can() method and delegate it to
   the URI member.  This also affects the URI::URL behaviour.
   Patch by Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>.



2001-07-19   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.15

   [This release was made just to document the changes that went
    into the (unreleased) URI-1.13 but never made it into this
    change-log.  There is no functional difference between the 1.14
    and 1.15 release.]



2001-07-18   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.14

   The module failed on perl5.004 because \z is not supported
   in regexps.  The Makefile.PL will now try to patch the module
   to be compatible.



2001-05-15   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.13 (never made it to CPAN)

   URI.pm now conforms to RFC 2732 which specify how literal IPv6
   addresses are to be included in URLs.

   URI/Escape now allows "/" in the $unsafe pattern argument.



2001-04-23   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.12

   URI->new($u, $scheme) does no longer fail if given a badly
   formatted scheme string.

   URI::WithBase's clone and base method was basically just
   broken.  This also affected the URI::URL subclass.
   The clone() method did not copy the base, and updating
   the base with the base method always set it to "1".



2001-02-27   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.11

   The t/heuristic.t test relied on the fact that 'www.perl.no'
   was not registered in DNS.  This is no longer true.
   The penguins at Bouvet Island will hopefully be ignorant
   of Perl forever.



2001-01-10   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.10

   The $u->query_form method will now escape spaces in
   form keys or values as '+' (instead of '%20').  This also
   affect the $mailto_uri->header() method.  This is actually
   the wrong thing to do, but this practise is now even
   documented in official places like
   http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1
   so we might as well follow the stream.

   URI::Heuristic did not work for domain-names with dashes '-'
   in them.  Fixed.

   Documented that $uri->xxx($1) might not work.



2000-08-16   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.09

   uri_unescape() did not work when given multiple strings
   to decode.  Patch by Nicholas Clark <nick@ccl4.org>.



2000-08-02   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.08

   ldap URIs now support _scope() and _filter() methods that
   don't have default values.  Suggested by Graham Barr.

   Incorporated old rejected MSWin32 patch to t/old-base.t.
   Hope it works.



2000-06-13   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.07

   character.

   Typo in URI::ldap spotted by Graham Barr.



1999-06-24   Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no>

   of $uri->query_form and $uri->query_keywords.

   Make compatibility URI::URL->new("mailto:gisle@aas.no")->netloc
   work again.

   all the documentation.

   Started to document the new modules.

   URI::file->new() escape fix which allow Mac file names like
   ::.. to be treated as they should (I think).
