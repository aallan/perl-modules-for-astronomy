It provides no functions or methods.



PREREQUISITES

You install HTML::Tagset, as you would install any perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of HTML::Tagset in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

DOCUMENTATION

POD-format documentation is included in Tagset.pm.  POD is readable
with the 'perldoc' utility.  See ChangeLog for recent changes.
