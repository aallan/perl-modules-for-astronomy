Astro::Coords
=============

A wrapper class around Astro::SLA that simplifies the handling of
astronomical coordinate systems. It can be used to convert between
J2000, B1950, Galactic and super Galactic coordinates.  It can
calculate the azimuth and elevation of a source specified in
equatorial coordinates, orbital elements or by name (if a planet).
It can also determine whether the specified coordinates are observable
for the given telescope.

This software is still an alpha release. The interfaces may still
change slightly.

Requirements
------------

This class uses Astro::SLA, Astro::Telescope and Time::Piece.


Building
--------

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

The test calculates the azimuth and elevation of a 3 sources
including a planet and a comet (Hale Bopp).
