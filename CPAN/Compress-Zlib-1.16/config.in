# 1. Do you want to build zlib as well?
#
#    If not, set the BUILD_ZLIB variable to False.
#
#    If you want to build the zlib library along with Compress::Zlib, first
#    fetch a copy of the zlib source distribution. The address ig given
#    in the README file. Unpack the zlib source distribution into the
#    Compress::Zlib source directory. If you have fetched zlib 1.1.3, it will
#    create a directory called zlib-1.1.3. 
#    Set the BUILD_ZLIB variable below to True. 

BUILD_ZLIB	= False
#BUILD_ZLIB	= True

# 2. Where are the files zlib.h and zconf.h?
#
#    Change the path below to point to the directory where zlib.h 
#    and zconf.h are installed on your system. 
#    If you have set BUILD_ZLIB above to True, the path should point to the
#    zlib source directory. A relative path is sufficient.

INCLUDE 	= /usr/local/include
#INCLUDE 	= ./zlib-1.1.3

# 3. Where is libz?
#
#    Change the path below to point to the directory where libz is
#    installed on your system.
#    If you have set BUILD_ZLIB above to True, the path should point to the
#    zlib source directory. A relative path is sufficient.

LIB	= /usr/local/lib
#LIB	= ./zlib-1.1.3

# end of file config.in
