Tk800.024 is mainly for compatibility with perl-5.7.3 and later
(various parts of perl's internals changed).

It has minimal changes from Tk800.023 apart from bug fixes.

This a re-port of a perl interface to Tk8.0.5 (Scriptics's production release).

It also includes all the C code parts of Ioi Kim Lam's Tix4.1.0.006 release.
The perl code corresponding to Tix's Tcl code is not fully implemented.

This version (Tk800.024) requires perl5.005 or later on Win32
and 5.004_04 or later on UNIX.

This version also contains re-worked Image code based on tcl/tk Img extension
(version img1.2.3) by Jan Nijtmans: http://members1.chello.nl/~j.nijtmans/
Jan's "dash" patch is also merged.

Tk800.024 should build and run on Windows NT using Visual C++, Borland,
or with the MinGW-1.1 port of GCC with perl5.005 or later.
Can be built using ActiveState's binary distribution
(see README-ActiveState.txt).

I have not tried a Borland build recently.

Author has built against:

  Perl5.7.3
   Pentium Suse Linux-7.3 gcc-2.95.3
   Win2000, MinGW-1.1 (gcc-2.95.3)
