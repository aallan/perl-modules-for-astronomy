BUGS

- $w->cget(-cursor) returns a wrong value if the -cursor was
  constructed with an anonymous array. Workaround: use the Tcl notation, e.g.
  -cursor => '{@/path/to/your/cursor.xbm} red blue'

- sporadic core dumps on the end of bbbike with the following backtrace:

- missing documentation: wrapper[1], $w->property, ConfigChanged,
  Tk::LabEntry (with advertised widgets etc.)

- The ButtonHack in Tk::BrowseEntry looks suspicious. Does it still
  work if there's more than one BrowseEntry per Toplevel? Maybe
  implement a better solution: there's a per-toplevel array or hash
  which is populated by the references to all containing BrowseEntries.
  The references are deleted OnDestroy of the BrowseEntry.

- Reported in Message-ID: <20030613095141.GA10412@zen.lcu>: The oneliners

  perl -e 'use Tk; tkinit()->Button(-text => 'Exit', -command => sub {exit 1})->pack; MainLoop();'

  and

  perl -e 'require Tk; import Tk; tkinit()->Button(-text => 'Exit', -command => sub {exit 1})->pack; MainLoop();'

  may cause segmentation faults or "Callback called exit" messages.
  The best is to avoid exit() at all and use $mw->destroy.

- cygwin:
  Expect 8 subtest failures:
  * all TList related tests fail
  * fileevent does not work

- Excess space in TopLevels (Message-ID:
  <yP%Ga.54900$nr.4758453@twister.southeast.rr.com>): this may be
  related to the well-known "slow raise" problem in conjunction with
  some weird layoutRequest code in Tk::ProgressBar

- Tk builds do not work if the source directory path contains spaces.

Please report bugs to either the Perl/Tk Mailing list
<ptk@lists.Stanford.EDU> or the Perl/Tk Newsgroup <comp.lang.perl.tk>.
