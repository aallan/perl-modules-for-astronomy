Changes in Tk800.000

Adopt tk8.0p2 and associated tcl8.0p2 where required.
Fix to build and run as much as possible on Solaris and Win32.

Menus and Fonts have changed radically in the core.

Tcl/Tk's menu.tcl has been hand converted (mostly) to Menu.pm and Menubutton.pm.
Menus mostly work - there will typo's in all that hand conversion.

No attempt has been made to make Font stuff visible to perl, indeed
existing Tk::Font is ideal candiate API (very close to what Tcl has), but probably
does not work at the moment.

Other big snag is fileevent is now completely broken on all platforms.
I need to re-implement enough of Tcl_Channel API on top of perl's file handles
to re-introduce it. This will be main focus of Tk800.001 ...

 Un-bundle Tk::Pod
 Un-bundle Tk::Contrib

Changes in 402.001

* Should now build with VC4.0, VC5.0 or Borland

* Right version of Tcl documentation merged.

* Scrollbars and Scales have default widths specified in physical units rather than
  pixels - so should not get over-large on low-resolution screens.

* Various build fixes.

* Tix4.1.0 (003) C code merged.

* Tixish updates from Rajappa Iyer.

* Changed to use Tix's Pixmap code rather than one using libxpm.
  (Libxpm has been a portability problem.
  (When Tk::Pixmap is loaded Tix's additional "builtin" Bitmaps and
   Pixmap id's are loaded too.)

* 'grid' can now be used "procedurally" :
    Tk::grid('-', $a, 'x', $b);

* New syntax supported to allow ConfigSpecs to cause configure option
  to configure a subwidget with a different named option.

* DefineBitmap interface added - Bitmaps can now be defined from perl code.
  Perl's 'pack' is very useful.

* Should build on top of sfio enabled perl.

* Tab traversal of Table's children permitted if Table does not take focus.

* Re-structured MainWindow moving 'CmdLine' into Tk::CmdLine.
  All perl/Tk apps now accept and honour command line switches described
  in X11R5 man page.  Some support of 'WM_SAVEYOURSELF' protocol.
  May need $mw->client setting.

* New demos from Steve Lidie - thanks as always.

  so we have the "orphan" implementation from Tix4.0.*
