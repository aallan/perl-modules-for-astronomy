NOTES:
=====

1. Versions of Tcl/Tk prior to 8.0 are no longer supported.
2. The makefile.bc and makefile.vc files are the ones from the 006
   release; we found the latter unusable with MSVC6.0, partly
   because it includes the file "common.mak" which was missing.
3. So, we have created a rather simple 'nmakefile' which seems to work
   with MSVC6.0. It was cobbled together from the makefile.vc in 
   tk8.0.5. Any improvements are welcome.
4. We have done only limited testing on Windows NT (SP3).
5. Please send comments, suggestions for improvements, bug reports,
   etc. to ram@netcom.com

BUILDING ON WINDOWS NT:
======================

1. You should have the Tcl/Tk 8.0 source distribution installed on
   your system.
2. Make sure that the location of the various Tcl/Tk dlls is in your
   PATH environment variable.
3. Edit nmakefile and change the definitions of
       TOOLS32, TOOLS32_rc, TCLDIR, and TKDIR
   to suit your environment.
4. From a DOS console window, run "nmake -f nmakefile > nmake.log"
   This should compile all the files, create object files in the
   "tcl8.0" subdirectory and save a log in the file nmake.log.
5. If the previous step was successful, edit "runtix.bat" and
   change the definitions of TCL_LIBRARY and TK_LIBRARY to suit your
   environment.
6. Now run "runtix"; this should pop up two windows, one of which is
   a tix console window where you can type Tcl commands; it should
   display a "%" prompt. Into this window type:
       source ../demos/widget
   This will display a tabbed notebook window which demonstrates many
   of the Tix megawidgets.
