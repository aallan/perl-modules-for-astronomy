	Major memory mis-use issue fix - if a callback got destroyed
	while being executed (e.g. did $button->destroy) then closure's

	Add some checking for the case that seems to occur during
	global destruction - have not caught it yet...

Change 1671 on 2000/02/13 by nick@ni-s

	More destroy-time REFCNT issues:                                 
	configure inquiries were causing incorrect REFCNT_inc-s of Callbacks
	and Vars.
	1. Make all LangXxxxArg functions which return SVs for tkConfig.c etc.
	   return SV _without_ incrementing REFCNT.
	2. Tweak odd uses of above where that was not correct assumption.
	3. Remove LangVarArg(), and replace with LangSetVar, only use was
	   in configure code and it could not be made to obey (1) above.  
	4. Tcl_ConcatObj and Tcl_NewListObj differ only in incomming REFCNT 
	   expectation.

	VERSION updates

Change 1595 on 1999/12/18 by nick@bactrian

	s/DoWhenIdle/afterIdle/ - auto-cancel is useful in all cases
	as far as I can see. Should re-instate C level optimization of 
	DoWhenIdle when it does auto-cancel too.

Change 1594 on 1999/12/18 by nick@ni-s

	highlighted by changes to "result" handling.

Change 1586 on 1999/12/12 by nick@ni-s

	Cleanup "harmless" oddities shown by Scalar/Array debug.

Change 1584 on 1999/12/11 by nick@bactrian

	Invert the logic of the scalar/array context assumption:
	 Rather than returning \@results in scalar context
	 return @$result if array ref is sole result in array context.
	This has same effect on the canvas and bbox cases and causes 
	less surprises with things like ->packSlaves.
	To make ->configure() work either way change it to return list 
	rather than appending items one at a time. That distinction is
	probably a bug...

Change 1583 on 1999/12/11 by nick@ni-s

	Honour scalar/list context when returning results
	This is (mainly) so that new canvas coords etc. are backward
	compatible with Tk800.015. Also affects bbox and configure
	but no one should notice...
	Add some tests for this, make Tk::Derived::configure conform
	and delete degenerate 'sub configure' in ColorEditor.

Change 1582 on 1999/12/11 by nick@ni-s

	Replace all Lang_SplitList, Lang_SplitString, LangAllocVec calls
	with equivalent Tcl_ListObj* code.

Change 1581 on 1999/12/11 by nick@ni-s

	Handle Tcl_ListObjGetElements() more intelligently:
	  1. Do not convert simple IVs and NVs to array refs 
	  2. Do Tcl string conversion in C    
	Change munging code to return "0" "1" etc. as integers 
	rather than strings.

	Versions

Change 1572 on 1999/12/08 by nick@pluto

Change 1570 on 1999/12/07 by nick@pluto

	Make index convert id's to position 

Change 1569 on 1999/12/06 by nick@pluto

Change 1565 on 1999/12/05 by nick@ni-s

	Basic group operations seem to work.

Change 1564 on 1999/12/04 by nick@ni-s

	Experimental "group" canvas item type.
	Also abstracted out item state fetch in item code
	so that rules can be changed in one place. 
	(tkCanvas.c and tkCanvPs.c still do it long hand ...)

Change 1563 on 1999/12/04 by nick@bactrian

	Allow [$x,$y] as equivalent to (and prefered to) "@x,y" for canvas->index()

	Add to MANIFEST<enter description here>

Change 1552 on 1999/12/02 by nick@pluto

	Correctly handle ->MenuDup of classes derived from Menu.
	
	To avoid silliness due to Menubar being a "kind of" Menu
	move all remaining functionality of Tk::Menubar into 
	either Frame (a pseudo constructor) or Menu (grandfather
	its methods as Menu methods). 
	
	Avoid an accidental list-of-options build due to ->configure() 
	when creating ->cascades with no arguments.

Change 1551 on 1999/12/02 by nick@pluto

	Allow -fg/-foreground etc. to be aliases to other things as well
	as each other.

Change 1546 on 1999/12/01 by nick@bactrian

Change 1516 on 1999/11/21 by nick@bactrian

	Attempt to re-code Tcl_GetStringFromObj() to behave better.
	Document snag with Lang_SplitString.

Change 1515 on 1999/11/21 by nick@bactrian

	Tcl_GetStringFromObj() forces lists like incoming callbacks to 
	string form. There is little we can do as only surounding code
	knows if it wants a callback or a list (e.g. font stuff) so 
	just avoid "native" stringify in favour of LangString() when 
	we want callbacks or other perl stuff. Suspect this is 1st of many...

Change 1514 on 1999/11/20 by nick@bactrian

	Move tkCanvPs to core as it provides useful utilities.
	 - note that the 'Cmd' part really should move back to Canvas.so

	Disable guiperl again does not build on ActivePerl

Change 1500 on 1999/11/10 by nick@pluto

	Relax restrictions on Compound images being tied to 
	single widget. Apart from some housekeeping and checking in tixImgCmp.c
	it is necessary to do bulk image cleanup before bulk font cleanup
	as we must give images a chance to release fonts.
	Other snaglet was need to use cached Display * in Compound exit code
	rather than asking now non-existant window.

Change 1499 on 1999/11/10 by nick@pluto

	Achim Bohnet <ach@mpe.mpg.de>
	Patch below has IMO 'useful cosmetic' changes for -w and strict checks
	so it's easier to spot possible errors
	
	o remove use AutoLoader when there's almost/ nothing to
	  autoload
	  Here I was not sure:
		X.pm: uses AutoLoader as fallback in it's own
			autoload routine but there's nothing to
			autoload.  Remove ???
		Toplevel.pm:  Only Autoloads Icon (and sub Icon
			has require Tk::Toplevel.  Why ???
	o ClassInit not autoloaded.
		Text, Scrollbar, Listbox still have ClassInit
		autoloaded.  I guess it's also no win here.
	o @ISA @EXPORT(_OK)? into use vars
	o Fixed one wrong $VERSION/package order in Radiobutton
	o added require Whatever before @ISA = Whatever

Change 639 on 1998/03/06 by nick@ni-s

	Make Name => handling in Tk::Widget::new more generic so that 
	menu -label values can be passed. Do so in Tk::Menu::Cascade
	so that a Help entry gets a menu called "help" and is 
	hence shown on the right.

Change 638 on 1998/03/05 by nick@pluto

	Re-work XSUB'ing of Tcl_CreateFileHandler and Tcl_DeleteFileHandler
	Make Tk::IO a TIEHANDLE package so that we can catch close.

	First attempt at mapping Menubar onto a real one now they exist.

Change 620 on 1998/02/28 by nick@ni-s

	Use <<Copy>> & co. new method in Tk/Clipboard.pm to use them
	code in MainWindow.pm to define them. Testing revealed Listbox Copy
	not working as expected due to name mis-match Getselected vs getSelected
	standardize on latter for symetry with other clipboard stuff.

	Use sv_setpvfn(), remove debug in palette stuff, beginings of event?

Change 610 on 1998/02/26 by nick@ni-s

	Re-work mechanism for returning result(s) from Tk to perl to be essentially
	same as it was prior to Tk8 merge. Instead of trying to mimic Tcl return
	scheme in perl, comprehend special case of perl/Tk's 'result' object 
	in objGlue.c. Without this re-work it was impossible to tell an empty
	string from an empty list. e.g. $widget->children returned undef 
	rather than () when there were no children.  

Change 609 on 1998/02/26 by nick@pluto

	Contrib fixes to Menu stuff + one of my own
	Tweak winfo stuff to return list for rgb again.

Change 607 on 1998/02/25 by nick@ni-s

	Slaven Rezic <eserte@cs.tu-berlin.de>
	The only event command working is "generate". Here's a patch to make

	Typo's in menu support

Change 591 on 1998/02/20 by nick@ni-s

	Part 1 of menu.tcl -> Menu.pm updates - so far we have most of 
	grab avoidance on non-unix - which may be why Win32 menus behave oddly.

Change 590 on 1998/02/18 by nick@ni-s

	Remove old libxpm based Pixmap completely now we have Tix and Img versions

Change 589 on 1998/02/18 by nick@pluto

	finds some other DllMain.

	newSV() takes args (unlike newAV and newHV)

	Add HINSTANCE finder func to WinInt and pull that in 
	in WinNotify. Arg-ify tkWinEmbed.
	Now runs large slab of demos/widget - but not basic demo.
	Menus seem to cause segfaults as does HList and text search.

Change 567 on 1998/02/12 by nick@pluto

	Leak fixes and blink Win32 'Eval' removal

Change 566 on 1998/02/11 by nick@camel

	Use Tcl_Alloc & co. to direct Tk's malloc/free to
	routines in tkGlue which use same malloc as perl.
	Worry was we had malloc / free mismatch. But seems
	we are leaking SVs in a major way.

Change 565 on 1998/02/11 by nick@ni-s

	Seems new Tcl_Obj have refcount of 0, so make SV's etc. we 
	create in their place 'mortal'.

Change 561 on 1998/02/10 by nick@ni-s

	Worst problems with finding cascade menus by name worked round.
	Still a problem when destroying as menu's tkwin is NULL.
	Perhaps objects were better after all.

Change 546 on 1998/02/08 by nick@camel

	Win32-isms - in particular "selection exists" is no longer
	in tcltk, and property listing is not supported and we have
	and issue with convert to/from X selection form which needs
	following up.
