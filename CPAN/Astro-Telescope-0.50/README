Astro::Telescope
================

This class can be used to retrieve and process details of particular
telescopes. It can be used to determine the location and altitude
of a telescope as well as the observational limits.

The list of supported telescopes can be obtained from the SLALIB
documentation: http://star-www.rl.ac.uk/star/docs/sun67.htx/sun67.html
(in particular the slaObs routine).

Requirements
------------

This class uses Astro::SLA. In the future this dependency will
be removed and the telescope tables will be kept internally.

Building
--------

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

The test make sure some simple parameters can be obtained and
that limits work as expected.
