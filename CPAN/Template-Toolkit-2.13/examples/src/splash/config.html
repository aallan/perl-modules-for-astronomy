[%  library = libs.splash

<p>
The splash/config file is used to specify various configuration values
for the Splash! library.  The most important item is 'splash.images'
which defines the URL prefix for the [% splash.bold %] images.  If 
this value is wrong, you'll notice that your interface elements don't
have smooth, rounded corners but empty, square chunks of broken image
links.  Afer that, everything is pretty much a matter of personal taste.
</p>

<p>
If you want to make changes without modifying the main configuration
file then you can always PROCESS the splash/config file and then
change values afterwards.  So you might have your own config file
(automatically processed as a PRE_PROCESS template, for example) which
does something like this:
</p>

[% TAGS star %]
[* WRAPPER source -*]
[% PROCESS splash/config;
   splash.images                 = '/~abw/tt2/splash/images'
   splash.style.default.col.fore = 'green75'
   splash.style.select.col.fore  = 'green50'
%]
[*- END *]
[* TAGS tt2 *]

<p>
Here's what your splash/config file currently looks like:
</p>

[%  INSERT splash/config WRAPPER source %]

[% END %]
