<p>
These elements can be used to create lists, items and indented
sections.  The html/list and html/item components are included for
completeness but in many cases it's overkill to use them unless you
plan to make your lists and items more fancy than regular &lt;ul&gt;
and &lt;li&gt; elements.  The html/indent element is particularly
useful for creating an indented section and is implemented as a 
right-aligned table, allowing background colour, internal alignment
and various other parameters to be specified.
