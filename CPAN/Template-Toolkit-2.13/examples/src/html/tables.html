<p>
These elements are for creating HTML tables and the rows and cells
within them.  In most cases, they offer little benefit over using the
regular HTML tags and are more likely to make your templates more
complicated and harder to read.  But on the other hand, they are
useful for various other elements which glue them together in
interesting ways to make more complex components (e.g. bars and
menus).  Think of them as HTML Lego&reg; bricks.
