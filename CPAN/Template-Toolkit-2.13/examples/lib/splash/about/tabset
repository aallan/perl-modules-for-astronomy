The splash/tabset template generates a set of tabs from the 
splash/tab template.  If there are more tabs in the set than 
denoted by the 'tab.limit' style value (currently set to
[% splash.style.default.tab.limit %]) then a scrolling tabset is created
showing the current selected tab along with the previous and next 
tabs in the set.
