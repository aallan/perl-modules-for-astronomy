<h3>Tapestry of Light and Dark</h3>

Create alternating areas of light and dark 
throughout the building, in such a way that 
people naturally walk toward the light,
whenever they are going to important places:
seats, entrances, stairs, passages, places of
special beauty, and make other areas darker,
to increase the contrast.
