<h3>Towns</h3>

We begin with that part of the language 
which defines a town or community.  These 
patterns can never be "designed" or "built" 
in one fell swoop - but patient, piecemeal 
growth, designed in such a way that every 
individual act is always helping to create 
or generate these larger global patterns, 
will, slowly and surely, over the years,
make a community that has these global 
patterns in it.
