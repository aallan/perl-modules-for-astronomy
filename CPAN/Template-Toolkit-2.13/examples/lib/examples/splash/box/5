<h3>Home Workshop</h3>

Make a place in the home, where substantial 
work can be done; not just a hobby, but a 
job.  Change the zoning laws to encourage
modest, quiet work operations to locate in
neighborhoods.  Give the workshop perhaps
a few hundred square feet; and locate it so
it can be seen from the street and the owner
can hang out a shingle.
