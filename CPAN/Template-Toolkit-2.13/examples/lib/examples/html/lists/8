Encourage the formation of self-governing workshops
and offices of 5 to 20 workers.  Make each group
autonomous - with respect to organization, style,
relation to other groups, hiring and firing, work
schedule.  Where the work is complicated and requires
larger organizations, several of these work groups 
can federate and cooperate to produce complex 
artifacts and services.
