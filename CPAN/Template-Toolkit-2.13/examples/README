This directory contains the source templates, components and
configuration file for building the HTML pages showing examples
of use of the 'html', 'ps' and 'splash' libraries.

The 'ttree.cfg' file is a default ttree configuration file which is
automatically generated at installation time when the Makefile.PL is
run.  It contains values based on those specified for the TT2
installation directory.

If the user requests it, then the pages for the examples are built at
run time when the "make install" happens.  This is achieved by calling
ttree and specifying the config file via the -f option.  Something
like this:

    $ ttree -f /usr/local/tt2/examples/ttree.cfg

All the source templates are in the 'src' directory.  The 'lib'
directory contains some general purpose template elements.

All the pages use relative links to reference each other, so you can
safely copy the generated HTML pages anywhere you like, symlink to it,
or do whatever else you need to do to make the pages visible to your
web server.  This may including setting the correct permissions to 
allow read access.
