    use Template::Stash::XS;</pre>

    title="DESCRIPTION"
-%]<p>
This module loads the XS version of Template::Stash::XS. It should 
behave very much like the old one, but run about twice as fast. 
See the synopsis above for usage information.
</p>
<p>
Only a few methods (such as get and set) have been implemented in XS. 
The others are inherited from Template::Stash.
</p>
[%- END %]
[% WRAPPER section
    title="NOTE"
-%]<p>
To always use the XS version of Stash, modify the Template/Config.pm 
module near line 45:
</p>
<pre> $STASH    = 'Template::Stash::XS';</pre>
<p>
If you make this change, then there is no need to explicitly create 
an instance of Template::Stash::XS as seen in the SYNOPSIS above. Just
use Template as normal.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, in your code add this line before creating a Template
object:
</p>
<pre> $Template::Config::STASH = 'Template::Stash::XS';</pre>
<p>
To use the original, pure-perl version restore this line in 
Template/Config.pm:
</p>
<pre> $STASH    = 'Template::Stash';</pre>
<p>
Or in your code:
</p>
<pre> $Template::Config::STASH = 'Template::Stash';</pre>
<p>
You can elect to have this performed once for you at installation
time by answering 'y' or 'n' to the question that asks if you want
to make the XS Stash the default.

[% WRAPPER section
    title="BUGS"
-%]<p>
Please report bugs to the Template Toolkit mailing list
templates@template-toolkit.org
</p>
<p>
As of version 2.05 of the Template Toolkit, use of the XS Stash is
known to have 2 potentially troublesome side effects.  The first
problem is that accesses to tied hashes (e.g. Apache::Session) may not
work as expected.  This should be fixed in an imminent release.  If
you are using tied hashes then it is suggested that you use the
regular Stash by default, or write a thin wrapper around your tied
hashes to enable the XS Stash to access items via regular method
calls.
</p>
<p>
The second potential problem is that enabling the XS Stash causes all
the Template Toolkit modules to be installed in an architecture
dependant library, e.g. in
</p>
<pre>    /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/i386-linux/Template</pre>
<p>
instead of 
</p>
<pre>    /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/Template</pre>
<p>
At the time of writing, we're not sure why this is happening but it's
likely that this is either a bug or intentional feature in the Perl
ExtUtils::MakeMaker module.  As far as I know, Perl always checks the
architecture dependant directories before the architecture independant
ones.  Therefore, a newer version of the Template Toolkit installed
with the XS Stash enabled should be used by Perl in preference to any
existing version using the regular stash.  However, if you install a 
future version of the Template Toolkit with the XS Stash disabled, you
may find that Perl continues to use the older version with XS Stash 
enabled in preference.
