 KNOWN PROBLEMS
 --------------

 Test t/02filter.t fails with perl 5.6.0 compiled with threads enabled
 This is due to a bug in 5.6.0 when compiled with threads, see
 http://bugs.perl.org/perlbug.cgi?req=tidmids&tidmids=20000409.003&range=32323&format=h

  - VirtualListView
  - Sort
  - Paged
* HTML version of the documentation is now included in the
  distribution
* Added Bundle::Net::LDAP
* Net::LDAP->schema can now be told where to search for the schema.

 KNOWN PROBLEMS
 --------------

  In a pre-release of 0.16 it has been seen that a search result may
  not contain all entries and $mesg->code will be LDAP_DECODING_ERROR.
  This has been seen when the client is running on NT or Linux and the
  server is an Exchange server.
