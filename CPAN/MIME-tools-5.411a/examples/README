THE PROGRAMS IN THIS DIRECTORY ARE CURRENTLY UNSUPPORTED EXAMPLES.

Examine them, hack them up, learn from them, etc.  They'll be
nicer in the future, I promise...

Many of these example programs will only work under Unix.  
If you are a Win32 user, stick to examples shown in the modules
themselves.
