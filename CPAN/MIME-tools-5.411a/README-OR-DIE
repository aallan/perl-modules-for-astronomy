INSTALLING ON WIN32:

Because of unix/Win32 file differences, the test file fun.txt, used in
the t\Decoder.t test, is different when the distribution is unpacked
with the cygwin tar/gunzip tools compared to when Winzip is used
(using the default options). The one created with Winzip is the one to
use to pass the tests.

MAJOR CHANGES FROM 3.0 TO 4.0:

   Temp files
	FileHandle::tmpfile is no longer emulated if you have Perl5.004,
	which has fixed the tmpfile() problem; you should (especially
	if running under Win32) get Perl5.004 ASAP.  Otherwise, the
        fairly-portable (if ugly) opendup() emulation is hardcoded.

   Module structure
        MIME::Latin1 is deprecated.
     
        MIME::IO is deprecated; its functionality has been replaced 
        by the IO::Scalar, IO::ScalarArray, and IO::Wrap modules.
	You will need these to run the toolkit.

	New encodings x-uuencode (x-uu) and x-gzip64 
	are now supported.

        MIME::Decoder has been split into a tree of modules.
   
   Encodings
        The '7bit' and '8bit' encoders now merely warn of transgressions;
        '7bit' no longer uses the deprecated MIME::Latin1.
	
	The 'quoted-printable' decoder now uses the newest MIME::QuotedPrint,
	and amends its output with guideline #8 from RFC2049 (From/.).

   Output
        Output format is slightly-different (but more sensible)
        if you use parse_nested_messages() or have singlepart entities
        with parts attached.  
	See MIME::Entity::print for details.
        
        As of 4.112, MIME::Entity::print_body recurses for multipart
        entities: this is more convenient and less surprising.

   Debugging
        All toolkit warnings may be turned off with config 'QUIET'.
        See MIME::ToolUtils for details.

MAJOR CHANGES FROM 1.0 TO 2.0:

   Module structure
	As of MIME-tools 2.0...

		MIME::Head is a subclass of Mail::Header
		MIME::Entity is a subclass of Mail::Internet

	If you are upgrading from the MIME-parser 1.0 package, and you used 
	these module directly, you may notice some warnings about deprecated 
	constructs in your code... much your stuff should (hopefully) 
	still work... you'll just see a lot of warnings.  

	There are some true incompatibilities between MIME::Head 1.0 and 
	Mail::Header.  Please read the full documentation before proceeding!
