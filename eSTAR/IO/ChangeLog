        * Updated to use the new eSTAR IO library which
          includes functions to actiavte and deactivate
          the GLOBUS modules. This means I can dispose
          of the libClient stuff, only one version of
          the GLOBUS IO library is being accessed. The
          problem was that the modules were being activated
          in the version of IO linked against eSTAR::Globus
          not that linked against eSTAR::IO (static linking!)

        * Total re-write due to unforseen problems with
          threading and GLOBUS loosing I/O handles when
          the temporarily pass out of scope. Working Client,
          tested against the LJM C test_server, but don't
          have a working Server yet.
