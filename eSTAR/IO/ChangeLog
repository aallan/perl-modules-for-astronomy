        * Server.pm: Fixed bug in close_server(), still getting
          attempt to from "unreferenced scalar" in the test
          harness server_test,pl, unsure why!?

        * Changed server code so it keeps the server internally
          as a static and doesn't pass it around. Unsure as to
          the effect in threading code? Needs testing.
          
        * Tested server code against LJM send_command and send_file.

        * Working server implementation using the mono-threaded
          server. Some problems with connection contexts remain.

        * Updated to use the new eSTAR IO library which
          includes functions to actiavte and deactivate
          the GLOBUS modules. This means I can dispose
          of the libClient stuff, only one version of
          the GLOBUS IO library is being accessed. The
          problem was that the modules were being activated
          in the version of IO linked against eSTAR::Globus
          not that linked against eSTAR::IO (static linking!)

        * Tested client code against the LJM test_server.

        * Total re-write due to unforseen problems with
          threading and GLOBUS loosing I/O handles when
          the temporarily pass out of scope.

        * Inital framework, most functions in place, missing
          Start_Server() Read_Message() and Write_Binary()
