        * Most of the parsing stuff implemented, no message creation code.
        
        * RTML.pm: Can now read an RTML message from a file and determine
          the message type. 
          
        * Parse/Parse.pm: In progress, most of the way there, with some
          glaring exceptions. Parsing code is awful, really should implement
          it as a recursive function to navigate tree passed from RTML.pm
          module. Unfortunately I think I'm going to have to "tinker" with
          it for certain commands, a generic recusrsive function could quickly
          get icky in this case.
